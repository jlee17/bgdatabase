			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Mind control is scary, but Dream Stealers do it all the time. It should scare you. One of your party is in an induced sleep, dreaming about you. Maybe if you scramble around inside his head you can protect your memories and personality. Try. Mauthelest is lurking and she&amp;rsquo;s interested in you. While you&amp;rsquo;re inside, take a look around and get a lay of the land. Maybe you can rescue Makou. She&amp;rsquo;s a victim, singing so aimless at the market gate, hollow eyed and stupid. Talk to the Dream Seller. She knows all about this stuff and what happened to Makou. She says she&amp;rsquo;s got a direct link to the Dragon Prince so maybe there&amp;rsquo;s an upside to all this? Beware, though the temptations of the market &amp;ndash; those water pipes? Like the watered wine flowing everywhere in the Beggars&amp;rsquo; Market, ubiquitous weed, but not for you. Depend on it.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
