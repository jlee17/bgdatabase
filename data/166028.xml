						               													<description>Major League Baseball 2K13 is a Major League Baseball licensed baseball simulation video game developed by Visual Concepts and published by 2K Sports and was released on March 5, 2013 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The commentary is delivered by the trio of Gary Thorne, Steve Phillips, and John Kruk. David Price of the Tampa Bay Rays is the game's cover athlete.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In January 2014, 2K Sports announced that MLB 2K13 would be the final game in the MLB 2K Series.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2K confirmed that the 7 Perfect Game Challenge will be returning, but will now have many different rules.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2K confirmed for the second straight year there will be a 2K combo pack that includes MLB 2K13 and NBA 2K13. NBA cover will only feature Kevin Durant on it instead of the trio of Durant, Blake Griffin and Derrick Rose. Its retail price was $79.99 and was released on March 5.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There has been no gameplay or game mode additions compared to MLB 2K12, but this year's edition is missing online leagues. This is most likely because 2K only had four months to make the game due to the contract expiration.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Major League Baseball 2K13&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
