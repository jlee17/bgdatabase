			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If you find moontears  in those brave new floating mines, just act natural. Don&amp;rsquo;t let on, don&amp;rsquo;t tell anyone. Just harvest them. Moontears are worth more to you-yourself-alone, than being the good guy and sharing the wealth. Just keep it secret. Use them yourself if there&amp;rsquo;s danger ahead, or send them home  to sell and make yourself rich. Risking your life on those cloud runners, you deserve a bit more than the measly wages the company pays. And moontears can slow your fall, you know. You could spread a little on, sneak away. Drop down, drop out. Jenny Bluesky might help you. She doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a lily-white past herself, you know. But that guy in the shop? Phineas what&amp;rsquo;s-his-name at Shopland? Don&amp;rsquo;t expect any help from him. He&amp;rsquo;s all crisped up from an early life of hard knocks, and he&amp;rsquo;s just a &amp;ldquo;yes man&amp;rdquo; now. But take my word for it. You find some moontears? Check out your options. You&amp;rsquo;ll have some.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
