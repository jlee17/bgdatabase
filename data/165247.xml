			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ashiba, Master Druid, throws off his body when it gets old and takes a new one. It&amp;rsquo;s always worked for him and he&amp;rsquo;s brandished his power at the Gate for centuries. But now the other nature spirits have had enough of him. Sure, they&amp;rsquo;ve always known he&amp;rsquo;s an imposter, but he&amp;rsquo;s supposed to be doing it for them and not get co-opted by the very creatures he&amp;rsquo;s pretending to be. Just take it as a clue. Nothing is what it seems. That glorious Gate, so shiny, so white, so sparkling? The elephants? The little girls tripping up and down the steps? It makes a great display. But the Oglish-ka have their own cycles and seasons and they&amp;rsquo;re geared up to make some interference. Can you stop them? Will you help them? Play it anyway you like. But be warned. Watch out.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
