						               													<description>Welcome to the wild lands of Feorhyrna, where grow the world&amp;rsquo;s most desired fruit&amp;mdash;the Royal Strawberry! Servants of the Imperial Court have been tasked with the mission of harvesting this magic fruit from the Emperor's private gardens. Upon arriving at the Imperial compound, however, the servants are chagrined to discover Raiders from the North climbing the walls, hastening to harvest the fabled fruit for themselves.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Imperial Harvest, players build a modular board replete with moats and hedges then take turns drafting a unique trio of fantastic champions who will either raid or protect the imperial strawberry patch. To be successful, each player must master the powers of their respective characters, navigate the Imperial Gardens, evade enemy attacks, and collect the majority of the realm&amp;rsquo;s mysterious, magical fruit.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Imperial Harvest takes place over 7 rounds (less, if all strawberries are plucked before game-end) and takes roughly 20 minutes to play. A cloth play mat is included in the game box for players that prefer not to create their own modular board or who prefer a quicker game setup. Each character in Imperial Harvest features a basic side (for novice/casual players) and an advanced side (for experienced/competitive players). Additionally, all components (garden tiles, character cards, etc.) are 100% compatible with Royal Strawberries (both games are stand-alone but also expand each other).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;IMPERIAL HARVEST: TAG TEAM (allows 2 additional players per additional copy of Imperial Harvest):&amp;#10;Grab another copy of Imperial Harvest, expand your board, and bring a new group of players to the table! With competitive tag-team rules, you and your allies can face-off against a team of worthy adversaries. By pairing skills and chaining more character actions, Imperial Harvest: Tag Team offers new creative strategies for navigating the board and cleverly collecting those precious strawberries. As always, only the craftiest team will win &amp;mdash; and watch out for those hydras!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
