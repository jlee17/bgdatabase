						               													<description>In this card game you try to avoid getting points, by playing cards to make words:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player get 10 cards, which contains letters and a number (value) and the rest of the cards are piled up; the top card is flipped and placed in a new pile.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The first player can now choose between taking the face-up card or take one blindly from the pile.&amp;#10;He now have to choose between ONE of three options:&amp;#10;1) Lay down a word infront of him&amp;#10;2) Add one or more letters to his own or another player's word.&amp;#10;3) Exchange a letter from his word to his hand - but not change the order of the letters.&amp;#10;It is only allowed to work on ONE word each turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;One card is a Joker; this one is worth 15 points and is a wild card. Any player can take pick it up if he can swap it with the represented letter.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Points are calculate when one player have no cards on his hands; He gets 0 points and the other players count the value on the cards they have on their hands. Then the next round can start.&amp;#10;If a player gets 100+ points he is out of the game. The game continues untill only one player is active.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
