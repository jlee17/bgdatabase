			               													<description>subtitle:&amp;#10;Articles and Handouts for 2300 AD&amp;#10;&amp;#10;from the Introduction:&amp;#10;I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing 2300 AD &amp;ndash; and using the rules to run crossover games in other universes &amp;ndash; since 1987. During the 1990s, I wrote a variety of articles for Challenge magazine about the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In addition, there were a number of items that never quite made it into print, but circulated as player handouts in my gaming group. I&amp;rsquo;ve included those too, so this document is essentially an archive of my 2300 AD writings, published or otherwise &amp;ndash; including the weird bits where the lines between my Traveller and 2300 AD games grew blurred.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Actually, as both game systems were produced by the same company, and in many cases by the same designers, scenarios, rules and so forth from one can be readily used in the other. I know, I&amp;rsquo;ve done it a great deal.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You can also find these articles online, with articles by many other 2300 AD gamers, at Pentapod&amp;rsquo;s World of 2300 AD*&amp;#10;&amp;#10;*site no longer available at the original address, but is cached at a new location - gmonk&amp;#10;&amp;#10;from Articles from Challenge Magazine&amp;#10;If you like, these are the &amp;ldquo;official&amp;rdquo; bits of the archive &amp;ndash; close enough to GDW&amp;rsquo;s vision of the game that they were published in Challenge magazine. So far as I know, the copyright on them reverted to me when GDW ceased trading.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
