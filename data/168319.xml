			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A group of adventurers plow through drifts of snow, driving towards a small town buried deep in the mountains. The townspeople sent out a call: autumn came early, and winter earlier. Something killed their crops and is burying them alive in snow and ice. Their town is dying.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Our Town Is Dying is a short, 2-encounter Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons adventure for Heroic Tier characters, who must head into the wilderness to confront the elemental forces that have brought winter so unnaturally early to this area.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each monster is presented in three variations, one for 1st level adventurers, one for 5th level, and one for 10th level.  As a result, it's easy to tweak the monsters for any party from 1st to 10th level.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
