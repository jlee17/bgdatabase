In the meantime, enemies come in and try to break your castle. They will try to burn it, explode it or even steal the pieces but you must get rid of them with the right items to reclaim control! &amp;#10;In &amp;quot;Protect the Castle&amp;quot; mode, you must keep the pre-made castles intact as much as possible by dealing with swarms of enemies attempting to take over... thankfully you have unlimited items in this frantic mode since the enemies are unlimited, too!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Source: The Developer Website.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
