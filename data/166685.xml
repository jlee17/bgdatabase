			               													<description>From the Introduction:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;        The King looked out of the window. It was high summer, and the fields expanded as far as the eye could see. The Owl Mountains loomed in the horizon. Some vultures could be seen circling in the sky.&amp;#10;        &amp;quot;The bandits took my girl&amp;quot;, the King uttered to the people in his throne room. The master of the guards averted his gaze. King's eyes were black and hard, yet full of sorrow.&amp;#10;        &amp;quot;Who will save my little princess?&amp;quot; the King shouted to nobody in particular. At the same time a door was pushed open. In came a man, black of skin and in his thirties. He had a long, blue cloak and a matching, wide-brimmed hat. He strode in with a confidence. Everybody fell silent.&amp;#10;        &amp;quot;I have come to save the princess&amp;quot;, the stranger said, smiling.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Traveller is a storytelling game of travelling and mystery. The inspiration comes from various sources, most important ones being Sapphire and Steel, various westerns and Adventures of Tintin.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
