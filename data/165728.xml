			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Battle the Ultimate Weapons!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Robots have long been a staple of science fiction, from hapless and harmless helper droids to incredibly deadly weapons of war. They have also been a part of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game for some time, and even have their own subtype, as well as rules for force fields, lasers, and plasma weapons. But Pathfinder robots have never been mythic&amp;hellip;until now.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This book presents two new robots for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, each of which has both a mythic and non-mythic version, for a total of 4 monster stat-blocks. Included are the autonomous assault platform (CRs 13 and 16), and the robot titan (CRs 20 and 25). The autonomous assault platform is a massive robot that is not just a fearsome combatant in its own right, but is capable of creating robotic minions on the spot, bringing its own army wherever it goes. Meanwhile, the robot titan is the ultimate in robotic combatants, with a dizzying array of weaponry, including (but not limited to) missile barrages, electro-webs, and a massive beam cannon.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
