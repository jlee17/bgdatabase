			               													<description>Publisher's description:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Animals walk among us in disguise.  These are their stories.  You'll laugh as a murder of crows carrying a suit tries to order a doughnut without being found out!  You'll cry as a work-a-day walrus must leave behind all that he knows when his true identity is discovered!  You'll sit on the edge of your seat as a covert war between birds and dinosaurs rages in the streets!  Take up your mantle as a member of the animal kingdom and join the eternal struggle for survival!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;From the Introduction:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Humans don&amp;rsquo;t know. Humans can never know. Humans are the dominant species on the planet. They run huge murderous factories to produce meat, relentlessly crush and crowd out any opposing population, and treat their own species with contempt the vast majority of the time. Yet, in this terrifying and dangerous setting that is the modern world other species live on, trying to continue their existences as peacefully as possible in the midst of the almighty human civilization that would crush them if they were ever found out. Many things have changed in the animal kingdom since the rise of the human species, but one thing remains the same: the ultimate goal is survival.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
