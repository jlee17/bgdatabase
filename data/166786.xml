						               													<description>Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution, known in Japan as Naruto Shipp&amp;#197;&amp;#171;den: Narutimate Storm Revolution (&amp;#239;&amp;#188;&amp;#174;&amp;#239;&amp;#188;&amp;#161;&amp;#239;&amp;#188;&amp;#178;&amp;#239;&amp;#188;&amp;#181;&amp;#239;&amp;#188;&amp;#180;&amp;#239;&amp;#188;&amp;#175;&amp;#239;&amp;#188;&amp;#141;&amp;#227;&amp;#131;&amp;#138;&amp;#227;&amp;#131;&amp;#171;&amp;#227;&amp;#131;&amp;#136;&amp;#239;&amp;#188;&amp;#141; &amp;#231;&amp;#150;&amp;#190;&amp;#233;&amp;#162;&amp;#168;&amp;#228;&amp;#188;&amp;#157; &amp;#227;&amp;#131;&amp;#138;&amp;#227;&amp;#131;&amp;#171;&amp;#227;&amp;#131;&amp;#134;&amp;#227;&amp;#130;&amp;#163;&amp;#227;&amp;#131;&amp;#161;&amp;#227;&amp;#131;&amp;#131;&amp;#227;&amp;#131;&amp;#136;&amp;#227;&amp;#130;&amp;#185;&amp;#227;&amp;#131;&amp;#136;&amp;#227;&amp;#131;&amp;#188;&amp;#227;&amp;#131;&amp;#160; &amp;#227;&amp;#131;&amp;#172;&amp;#227;&amp;#131;&amp;#156;&amp;#227;&amp;#131;&amp;#170;&amp;#227;&amp;#131;&amp;#165;&amp;#227;&amp;#131;&amp;#188;&amp;#227;&amp;#130;&amp;#183;&amp;#227;&amp;#131;&amp;#167;&amp;#227;&amp;#131;&amp;#179;?) is a fighting game developed by CyberConnect2 and published by Namco-Bandai as part of the Naruto: Ultimate Ninja video game series, based on the manga &amp;quot;Naruto&amp;quot; by Masashi Kishimoto. It is a sequel to the 2013 game Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3. The game was released on September 2014 in Japan, North America, and Europe.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game features a revamped fighting system. It includes new ways of forming teams based on their skills as well as counterattacks and guard breaks. Masashi Kishimoto worked in the game by providing the new character Mecha Naruto as well as new designs for the characters belonging to the organization Akatsuki whose back-stories are being told in this game. The game also includes a tournament mode where the player can battle against three CPU fighters at the same time. Players are also able to customize characters.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gameplay&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game introduced guard-break and counterattack. In the former, the player breaks the guard of the opponent, knocking him or her unconscious. This gives the player the opportunity to unleash a deadly attack to inflict serious damage. There is a limit, however, on the number of times it can be used. In regards to the counterattack, if an opponent is about to land an attack on the player, the players can knock them unconscious, rendering them helpless and sealing their support. Timing is the key here and a counterattack is a chakra-consuming action. The game also features a revamped support system. There are largely three types of teams. The Drive type locks the battle with a Sealed Barrier that always activates the Support Drive ability. Support Drives call in other team members to chain attacks with the player's main character or block for him depending on the type of support the three man cell provides. Ultimate Jutsu type is a team that can do a heavy damage super attack, which depends on the team the player use. Awakening team types can use an awakening at the start of the battle by using the right analog stick.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game has 118 playable characters, with new characters being added in addition to returning ones. Series creator Masashi Kishimoto was involved in the game to design an original character: a robot version of Naruto named Mecha-Naruto who has a two-stage awakening: a three-tails transformation and a Mecha-Kurama transformation. Playing a role in the newly introduced four-player Tournament Mode, Mecha-Naruto appears in a two-part episode of the Naruto Shippuden series that aired on the day of the game's release in Japan. In addition to the new character, Kishimoto also designed new costumes for Sasori, Deidara, Hidan, Kakuzu, and Orochimaru, as well as the design for a technique used by one of the game's new characters, Shisui Uchiha.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In addition to following the series canon until the latest animated episode, the game features new side stories. These include stories about Akatsuki, Shisui Uchiha and Kushina Uzumaki. After working to create new animations for Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Generations, the developer of Naruto anime series, Studio Pierrot was once again involved to animate 50 minutes worth of animation for the new side stories.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Plot&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The first of three original animated stories, &amp;quot;Creation of the Akatsuki&amp;quot;, reveals the origins of the new group's membership. After the events that lead to Yahiko's death, Obito appears in his Tobi guise before Pain and Konan after the former killed Hanzo and gain control of the Hidden Rain Village. Obito tells them to rebuild the Akatsuki's ranks with a membership of ten as he instructs Pain and Zetsu to recruit Kakuzu while Konan drafts Sasori. At that time, Obito personally recruits Itachi and then Kisame. Later, Orochimaru manages to attract the Akatsuki's attention to join their ranks for his own purposes. After the recruitment of Deidara by Itachi and Hidan by Kakuzu and Orochimaru, the Akatsuki's ranks are complete as they begin their mission to find and capture the tailed Beasts. The second story is tells of Shisui Uchiha at the time of his death while the third, &amp;quot;The Far Reaches of Hope&amp;quot;, depicts Kushina Uzumaki interacting with a young Obito and the rest of Team Minato.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
