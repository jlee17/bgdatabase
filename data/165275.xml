			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Hermit&amp;rsquo;s Rock needs help. There&amp;rsquo;s a struggle going on&amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s the were-types who live for bleeding and screaming pitted against those who want equal rights for the weres. The more strictly human types are mixing it up, too. They want to keep the were-folks out of the southlands entirely. But before you sign to one contingent or the other? Couple of things to keep in mind. This Rock is a were-recruitment center, so there are lots of different types, old and young, coming and going. See Mistra there, that curly, soft, rich, girl-brat? She&amp;rsquo;s a recruit. (Doesn&amp;rsquo;t know what she&amp;rsquo;s getting into.) Then there are the hard to grok, sentient shadow types released into #77. They&amp;rsquo;re messing with all sides equally.  Likely you won&amp;rsquo;t want to join them. But talk to Finaius. Talk to Darbin. Just don&amp;rsquo;t turn your back. Don&amp;rsquo;t walk away. Sign up. Sign now.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
