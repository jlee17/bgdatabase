			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Woodhamer Cooperage is about the best there is, but it&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s in the power plant that will really get you going. That&amp;rsquo;s where mad inventor Krvis Kyles works. Where did he come from? What&amp;rsquo;s he up to? That&amp;rsquo;s probably all to be determined somewhere further down the line. For now? Just be sure that he&amp;rsquo;s your man. People say, &amp;ldquo;Too much pipe, too many years.&amp;rdquo; Wrong. Krvis is just too smart. Now the winds of war are tuning up. The Earl of Sorlis and Adrous the Cooper are doing their part. But the one who&amp;rsquo;s going to make the real difference is Kyles. He&amp;rsquo;s a weapons man with good ideas always ready to pop. See that steam-powered metal man? If there&amp;rsquo;s going to be a fight, strap on a Steam Dragon and get behind that thing. You&amp;rsquo;ll get to tell the story for sure.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
