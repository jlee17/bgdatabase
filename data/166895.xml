						               													<description>&amp;ldquo;It was here that an alliance of Federal inspectors and police, Malone with them, entered the case.&amp;rdquo;&amp;#10;    &amp;ndash;H.P. Lovecraft, The Horror at Red Hook&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For the Greater Good is the eighth deluxe expansion for Call of Cthulhu: The Card Game. As the Agency reinforces and expands its network, roughly two-thirds of the expansion&amp;rsquo;s 165 cards (three copies each of fifty-five different cards) lend new strength to the faction's heroic champions of law and order. Numerous police officers, military officials, investigators, and psychiatrists bolster the Government subtype, even as several new Hunter characters track the game&amp;rsquo;s monsters and otherworldly evils across the earth, seeking to purge them from our world.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Of course, the confrontations of Call of Cthulhu: The Card Game are rife with violence and horror, so For the Greater Good grants Agency members access to plenty of new weapons and vehicles to aid them in their efforts. You&amp;rsquo;ll find a host of new synergies between Agency subtypes, new gear, and powerful effects designed to renew the authority of law and order in a world tormented by burgeoning chaos. Moreover, as your Agency characters pursue their leads to all ends of the earth, you&amp;rsquo;ll uncover several new conspiracies, each of which, if investigated, may help you safeguard humanity&amp;rsquo;s future.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Polish your badges, grab your shotguns, and deputize the bravest and best of all the people close to you. While the world is threatened on all sides by ghouls, cultists, monsters, and Ancient Ones, humanity needs all the help it can get&amp;hellip;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
