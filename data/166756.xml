			               													<description>From Introduction:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Long ago, prophets and wizards alike could count themselves no strangers to innumerable demons, great and small. Of all those called upon by the many cults of the ancient world, few were as feared by their enemies as Lepravosia, Devourer of Thieves. Her statues and icons still haunt many a forgotten temple, waiting in the darkness for intruders intent on plundering what treasures remain unclaimed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If she is summoned to the material plane, Lepravosia appears in the form of a human woman, very tall, and with a head that consists of only a mouth and bloody pulp, with several sickening eel-like tentacles extending from it. She has no real internal organs other than a stomach, which can stretch to accommodate the bodies of at least a dozen thieves.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Her victims should not be surprised to see her, unless they are incompetent thieves indeed, for her images &amp;mdash; in great numbers and variations, from bloated ladies with the heads of eels to gluttonous hags swallowing men &amp;mdash; adorn every temple she protects. It is rare for a cult or wizard to call upon her now, in these tarnished days, for the old arts die out and are not revived for fear of the dangers involved. But if the bards are to be believed, there are countless ruined temples still stuffed to the rafters with the loot and gems that made the ancient world such a golden age. If they were so easy to loot, they would be empty by now, so clearly some must still be under Lepravosia's benefaction. But not all &amp;mdash; that would be impossible. And so the question remains: Is it worth the risk?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
