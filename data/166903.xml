						               													<description>Colaville is the soft drink capital of the world where the soda fountains never run dry. Drug stores have popped up all over town, serving up endless varieties of tasty concoctions. In this &amp;ldquo;take that&amp;rdquo; style game, players take the role of a Soda Jerk at one of these drug stores where they will try to make as much money as they can by bringing in customers who want what they have, while sending soda and customers to other players to try and cost them money. Stealing customers and soda will help but a fire could strike at any time, forcing a player to start from scratch. The game ends when the draw pile is exhausted with the player who made the most money being declared the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During the draw phase of each player's turn, players draw as many cards as there are players and play each one of them according to their rules. There are four types of cards:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Customers - Who are brought in by playing them in front of the player who drew them but they can sent to other player's drug stores instead by placing them in front of the other players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Sodas - Like customers they can be played in front of the player who drew them or played in front of another player.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Soda Jerks - Are dealt before the game begins and gives each player a special ability that can be used once per game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Events - A variety of events can hurt or help a player depending on which one is drawn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
