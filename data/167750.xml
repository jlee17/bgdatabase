						               													<description>Mission Background&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Last Tango is an entry in the 2013 New Mexico Game Jam. The theme of the jam was &amp;quot;It takes two to Tango.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game was developed in 48 hours by one person using Unity, Photoshop, and BBEdit on an Apple AIR Laptop. All graphics, gameplay, and programming is original, developed specifically for this compo.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Setup&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Nothing ruins a honeymoon like a bullet.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Superspies James and Anya are trying to enjoy their honeymoon, but they are marked for death by a raft of syndicates, governments, and masterminds.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Can they keep the romance alive?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Approach&amp;#10;&amp;#10;James and Anya are dancing.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You control the dance moves they do by either clicking on the buttons at the bottom of the screen, or by pressing the associated keyboard keys.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As James and Anya come out of their current dance move, they'll take the move you've selected and begin performing that move.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;They're not going to stand around and wait for you. If you don't have a dance move queued up for them, they'll just keep dancing on their own.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Because they are superspies, some of their dance moves can be deadly for their attackers. Experiment and learn what the dangers are and what moves defeat them!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Good luck!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Source: The Game Website.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
