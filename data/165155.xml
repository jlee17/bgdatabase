			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In an old dark forest far sits a clearing where nothing will grow. Here long ago a sorcerer from another world began a great ritual. Now he is imprisoned but his mad apprentice wishes to finish it. But he is not the only one. The god-king wants to use the ritual to gain more power. All that stand between them and the last steps of the ritual are the Forest Wardens, an unfinished magic sword and perhaps your party.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
