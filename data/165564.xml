						               													<description>From the manual&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You are a country trying to achieve the status of Nuclear Superpower. Once you have Superpower status you can shape the world you want to live in. Do you want to nuke or disarm your neighbors? Will you create global peace or Mutually Assured Destruction?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;User addition&amp;#10;Nuclear Poker is a fast playing (10 minutes) card game where users use threats, bluff, trade and psychology to gain nuclear supremacy over the other players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is meant a fast paced, light hearted, cutthroat game which teaches the participants something about global nuclear warfare and policies like Mutually Assured Destruction.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players gather components cards (Uranium, Refinement, Warhead and Test) to get functional nukes. After that they can gather Short Range capability, Second Strike, Long Range and ultimately Superpower. Firing at another player instantly eliminates the other player from the game (unless he owns Second Strike, which allows for one last attack)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is sold with an inbuilt expansion about biochemical weapons, which work likewise: when you own Superpower and gather Lab and Plague, every other player is instantly dead unless he owns Lab too. This makes for even shorter games.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
