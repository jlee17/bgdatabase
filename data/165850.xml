			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The HE-111-Z was created by fusing two obsolete airplanes together and adding a fifth engine. Originally intended to serve as a tow plane for gliders, the HE-111-Z was assigned to frontline service as an improvised heavy bomber when the pilots and engineers realized its tremendous payload capacity and endurance. Symbolic of Germany's innovative engineering, the HE-111-Z has been ubiquitous over the skies of Europe since 1945.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The HE-111-Z also involves many other technical advances to keep it competitive against Allied fighters. Each HE-111-Z features an embarked &amp;quot;parasite&amp;quot; fighter, a small jet powered fighter that is mounted on the back of the bomber. The jet fighter can launch, intercept enemy aircraft, then return to its mount on the back of the HE-111-Z, thereby providing a very fuel efficient, high-speed escort with the same range capability of the HE-111-Z.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The HE-111-Z is also associated with the Giant glider. It was for this glider that the HE-111-Z was first designed. The HE-111-Z is one of only a few planes in the Luftwaffe capable of hauling a fully loaded Giant into the sky.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This file includes:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     4 Photos of the HE-111-Z&amp;#10;     History of the HE-111-Z engineering project&amp;#10;     d20 stats for the HE-111-Z&amp;#10;     d20 stats for ME-328 parasite fighter&amp;#10;     d20 stats for the Giant glider&amp;#10;     d20 stats for the Giant glider&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
