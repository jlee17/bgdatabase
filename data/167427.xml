						               													<description>All begins at the time you enter the KILL ZONE. KILL ZONE, an area where a bomb is planted within a radius of 25m, is so dangerous because of the possibility of an explosion. You, as an EOD agent, must render the bomb safe. But be careful! There is a spy in your team who wants the bomb to be set off. I wish you could carry out the duty and come back&amp;hellip;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Goal&amp;#10;Each player will be a dealer (spy) in turn. Players including the dealer are charged with the bomb disposal mission. There are 8 wires on the bomb, but only one of them is a detonator. If you successfully cut the wire except the detonator, you will be promoted to the next rank as a reward. Otherwise, however, you and your companion will be demoted if the bomb is exploded. With several missions, the player with the highest rank wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game Play&amp;#10;At the start of game, each player takes own rank tiles. The player with the lowest rank takes the Dealer Tile and starts the game as a first dealer (spy).&amp;#10;The player with the lowest rank starts the turn. Each player performs one of the following actions on their turn: Cutting a wire or Play a card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    Cutting a wire: Place a Nipper Tile on one of the wires of the Game Board. You cannot place a Nipper Tile on previously cut wires. If a player cut a non-detonator wire, the dealer should announce &amp;lsquo;Promotion&amp;rsquo; (Or should say some words to announce such as &amp;lsquo;Success&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;Safe&amp;rsquo;). The player is promoted one step higher. The turn goes to the next player (the player with the lowest rank).&amp;#10;    Bomb Disposal: If all wires except the detonator are cut, the bomb is rendered safe. All players successfully complete their mission, and the round ends. However, the dealer is caught being a spy, and he will be demoted one step lower.&amp;#10;    Bomb Explosion (Cutting a detonator): While playing a round, if a player cut the detonator, the dealer announces &amp;lsquo;Boom!&amp;rsquo; The bomb is exploded, and the round ends immediately. The player who cut the detonator will be demoted two steps lower. Also, the player(s) on his left/right side will be demoted a step lower.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The round ends when the bomb is disposed or exploded. Start the next round with the current rank.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game ends&amp;#10;The game ends if any of the following situations occur:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    All players played as a dealer once each. (The round is played as the number of players.)&amp;#10;    A player achieved the rank &amp;lsquo;General of the Army (Lv. 23)&amp;rsquo; (The game ends immediately.)&amp;#10;    A player is demoted even lower than the rank &amp;lsquo;Private (Lv. 0)&amp;rsquo; (The game ends immediately.)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After the game ends, the player with the highest rank wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
