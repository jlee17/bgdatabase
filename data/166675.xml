Another new feature is The Concept Squad, where players have an access to the game's database and can create a &amp;quot;dream squad&amp;quot;. The concept player's card is grey colored. A number of new legends are also introduced to the game, including Franz Beckenbauer, Roberto Carlos, Peter Schmeichel and Hristo Stoichkov.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Licensing&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A full list of the game's leagues, clubs and national teams was published on its official website on 18 September with the description &amp;quot;Experience true football authenticity with FIFA 15 - featuring 35 licensed leagues, over 600 clubs, 16,000+ players and 41 licensed stadiums&amp;quot;.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;EA Sports had signed a deal with the Premier League as the Official Sports Technology Partner.

However, the official Premier League graphics are only visible on the PC, PS4 and Xbox One versions of the game. The PS3 and Xbox 360 versions will continue to use generic EA Sports branded graphics for these matches.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;FIFA 15&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
