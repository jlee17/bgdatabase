			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Welcome to the third installment of the Advancing with Class series.  This supplement focuses on a brand new class: The Physicist. A spell caster like no other, with the ability to spontaneously become stronger, more enduring, or more agile as well as pass these enhancments off to others.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Why should only the more intellectual or spirital characters have access to casting magic spells? What if you could use your Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution to power your own set of magics? The Physicist is a new class that allows your character to focus on one of his physical attributes to empower magics to give the party the edge when it comes to dealing with more powerful creatures.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Sure, you can&amp;rsquo;t cast a Fireball, but who needs to when you have the strength of a Giant or the indomitable spirit of a Dragon? And not only that, you can share this power with your friends and allies.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Included is the Physicist class, a Psionic version of the Physicist, several archetypes, new spells, and feats. Welcome to the magics of Physic!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
