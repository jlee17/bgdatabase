						               													<description>From the back of the box:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;An easy and challenging game for the whole family. You are in charge of a group of warriors and must win the saga by using strategy and fantasy. The different groups, sagas and sceneries make the game a new adventure every time you play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player selects a team of generic fantasy creatures, ranging from humans and e&amp;#197;&amp;#130;ves to undead and demons. Each team consists of 4 to 6 pieces.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When teams have been selected, one of the players rolls a ten-sided dice to determine which saga the players will play. These range from simple &amp;quot;Death matchs&amp;quot; to gathering chests.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Now the players form the board by placing lagre hexagon map pieces. Each map pieces contains smaller hexagons and terrain features like houses, trees and rocks.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each saga (scenario) has a trigger. When a certain point in the game is reach, for example by losing half of your team, a set of &amp;quot;Time piece&amp;quot; markers is placed beside the game board. Each full turn a marker is turned and when a red time piece is revealed the game stops.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the end points are calculated by simple measures such how many playing pieces you have left or how many treasure chests you've got.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
