						               													<description>In this turn based RPG for Windows you play as a young mercenary and travel from soul to soul to avenge your fiance and her family. While finding a way to change the flow of past events, you will encounter many obstacles and meet new allies. Will you be brave enough?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This game aims to revive nostalgic moments for good old RPG fanatics (such as Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy 3...). There are still a lot of retro gamers out there! We focus on getting the attention of new gamers as well by making some innovations. Our game has no game over screen; once the hero dies, his soul is sent to the underworld, to meet the Soul Giver. At this point, it is possible to re-embody a new body (therefore several choices of classes: Warrior, Assassin, Mage, Hunter ...). In addition, once a character masters a technique, it is learned permanently in the mind of the hero. It is therefore possible to transfer a warrior's ability to a magician. This leads toward interesting gameplay combinations.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;What makes the game unique and fun to play: &amp;#10;- Dark, mysterious and ever-changing storyline &amp;#10;- Unique class &amp;amp; death system &amp;#10;- High replay value. &amp;#10;- Various treasure hunting. &amp;#10;- Easy crafting system&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If you are a fan of old good RPG games, this one is surely for YOU!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Source: The Developer Website.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
