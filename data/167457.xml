						               													<description>A settlement building game for fans of the isometric strategy boom of the late 90's&amp;#10;In IsoImperial you are the new lord of a settlement being built in the Middle Ages on the feudal country of Ingland.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players get to play as competitively or cooperatively as they like, as well as a solitaire single player variant.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;IsoImperial gives players over 30 different buildings to build their new settlement from a small hamlet, all the way to a bustling city. Building types consist of residential buildings, goods and economic buildings, buildings required for growth as well as the military and defence buildings required for keeping players, and random events out of your settlement.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Having a constant income is only part of the struggle, with droughts, floods, fires, roaming bandits and more coming into play. As well as balancing your stretch to victory without becoming a prime target for other players and their military.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Multiple paths to victory, be the first to achieve a city, or last 24 in game months and come out with the best score across multiple categories.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Small enough to play anywhere, big enough to get stuck in.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Isometric artwork heralds back to the late 90's strategy and empire building boom.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
