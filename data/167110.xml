			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Madison Avenue, the only place to be if you're in the advertising game. Looking down on the bustle and movement from the windows of 17th floor that your agency leases, a drink in your hand and the pressure to come up with the next big thing, you are living the life. The life, however, consists of stress, excessive drinking, illicit affairs, and plenty of secrets interwoven into the glam and glitz that money brings. Your life may look great from the outside, and you are the envy of the town, but you go to extremes to hold it all together. In your world, when things break, they break in the most spectacular ways. Maybe you chose this world and were ready for the cut-throat politics and struggles you would face on the rise to the top, or maybe you are an innocent bystander drawn in through your work, your spouse, or your innocent desire to be somebody. You aren't likely to get out without getting a little dirty.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Get your suit, press your dress, grab the cigarettes and the booze, and get ready to spin things in your favor as you try to work your way to the top or get out before the stress makes your exit permanent.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
