			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The land of Sexonia is a dangerous place, a land of fantasy and adventure beyond your wildest imaginings. Maybe you got into adventuring because your village was destroyed by orcs, or to prevent fire elementals from taking over your kingdom, or maybe just because it was better than staying at home and settling down with that nice boy that your parents wanted you to marry. Whatever the reason, you can&amp;rsquo;t go home now. The kingdom needs you. And more importantly, that chain mail makes you look totally hot. Are you seeing anyone right now? Could I maybe buy you an ale some time?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;...I&amp;rsquo;m sorry, where was I?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Adventure! Danger! Sexy outfits! Come, fellow adventurers. It&amp;rsquo;s sexytime.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;SexyTime Adventures: the RPG is a Dungeon World hack in which you play a party of fantasy adventurers having adventures and being sexy.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;THIS GAME IS A WORK OF SATIRE.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
