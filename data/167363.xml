						               													<description>Monsters is a 2D action shooter inspired by the classic arcade game Robotron 2084. Wielding &amp;ldquo;twin stick&amp;rdquo; controls, the player aims to defeat waves of enemy monsters bent on his destruction. The player must use caution, however, as every shot drains the player&amp;rsquo;s life/energy. The only way to stay alive is to continuously collect the hearts of the slain monsters. In addition, hearts of different colors provide a variety of &amp;ldquo;power-up&amp;rdquo; like abilities that the player can use to their advantage.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The player uses two sets of controls, one to move, the other to fire. Each wave is a single screen populated with a number of enemy monsters of varying types. Coming into contact with an enemy or an enemy projectile will decrease the player&amp;rsquo;s life/energy. Defeating each level of monsters will allow the player to progress to a more difficult level. The game will progress infinitely as the player defeats each level.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Source: The Developer Website.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
