						               													<description>ABOUT SUPERHOT&amp;#10;&amp;#10;SUPERHOT is a unique, stylish first-person shooter game where time moves only when you move.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;With this simple mechanic we've been able to create gameplay that's not all about reflexes - the player's main weapon is careful aiming and smart planning - while not compromising on the dynamic feeling of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Take your time. You have as much as you want.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It started out as a 7 Day First Person Shooter (7DFPS) game jam project made by a group of friends in August 2013. After releasing the prototype of SUPERHOT to the Internet, it quickly became very popular - the game was featured on sites like RPS, PCGamer, GiantBomb and more!.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Thanks to the support of our fans, SUPERHOT went through the Steam Greenlight process during a single weekend. This allowed us to expand the team and start remaking the prototype into a full-blown game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On May 14th, 2014 we launched a Kickstarter campaign which was funded within the first 23 hours. In the end we received over $250,000 from our community - many thanks to all who backed SUPERHOT!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game's target release date is June 2015.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Source: The Developer Website.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
