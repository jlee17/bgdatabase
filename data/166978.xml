						               													<description>That inevitable zombie apocalypse has finally come, and you find yourself holed up the city with a ragtag group of survivors. You've heard rumors of a safe house out in the countryside, but you need to find a vehicle capable of getting you there and chances are not all of you will make it. Work with the other members of your group to survive and collect vehicle components, but when the time comes you may have to make a choice: do you run away and leave them for dead, or do you stay true to your word and risk being betrayed yourself?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Survivors is a semi-cooperative card game in which players search for vehicles they can use to escape while dodging ravenous zombie hordes. On each round, players are secretly dealt 2 zombie cards each and must choose the best action card in their hand to deal with them. This is where you are faced with an interesting choice: do you help the other players and risk betrayal, or do you betray them yourself and leave them to die?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the end of each round you will get to search the city for items that help you survive and escape, but even if you find a way out, you may not be able to take everyone with you...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
