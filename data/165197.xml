			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This week toys for the sandbox goes shopping at the Goblin Market and what could possibly go wrong. There is more on sale then miniature animals and rat skin pouches that are always full of copper, you can also pick up family squabbles, cursed badgers (okay so technically the curse is being a badger), goblins who overvalue their fashion sense and much more. So much more that we expanded the item section from 2 to 10 items and even give a rough idea of their value, plus we added an extra chart for when your players are browsing the shops.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
