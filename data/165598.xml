						               													<description>BACKGROUND: Soldiers of Glory is an adventure game for 1-4 Players, where players assume the roles of young Soldiers of Fortune during the 1600s. Each Player creates a Hero Character in search of Wealth, Adventure and Renown. To survive and thrive in a land torn apart by Religious Wars, Intrigue, Piracy and Plague, the Player Heroes must seek employment from a variety of Patrons and perform Assignments such as escorting envoys, participating in Battles, dueling rivals, espionage, political intrigue, rescuing damsels, and assassinations. As your Hero gains experience and renown they can improve their attributes and status.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;GAME OBJECTIVE: The Objective of each Player Hero is to Gain as much Renown Points (RP) to become a Nobleman. Game length is determined by the Nobility Title desired: Baron (60RP), Count (80RP) or Duke (100RP). In order to become a Nobleman, the Player Hero must complete Assignments to earn enough RP to purchase the various Titles.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;GAME FEATURES: Soldiers of Glory features lots and lots of colorful game counters including Swordsmen, Cavaliers, Brigands, Soldiers, Assassins, Nobles, Femmes Fatal, fierce animals, and much more. The game is played on a 6 Sheet Map with Large Hexes and a variety of terrain. Game includes Duels, Skirmishes, Battles, Fortress Assaults, Combat at Sea, Pirates and more.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If you are a fan of the Three Musketeers, any Errol Flynn movie, Alatriste, and other swashbuckling tales, this game is for you.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;ASSEMBLY TIME: This game, since there are a lot of counters, may take longer than the designer's other games. It took me about 4 hours at industrious pace.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
