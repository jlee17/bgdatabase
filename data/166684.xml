			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Caves of Moreau County is an adventure module for Labyrinth Lord. The various sections of this dungeon are random and modular&amp;mdash;there is no mandated way for them to fit together. You can generate the actual structure of the dungeon before you play, or do it during the game, partly in response to the players' decisions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The dungeon consists primarily of beastmen in caves with a few twists and buried secrets. It is a fairly dark adventure, written from the perspective of murderhobo PCs. It's gritty, horror-saturated old school fantasy, in case that is or isn't your bag. Or just check it out for yourself, since you can get it for free if you want to.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This module was created to be a proof-of-concept prototype, to see how well this format works, and what needs to be done to make it work better. As such, the text is released under a Creative Commons license and the PDF is offered here as Pay What You Want. Monetary support goes towards creating more role-playing game materials. If you enjoy this module, you might also consider purchasing some of my other books, if you haven't already.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
