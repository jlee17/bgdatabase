						               													<description>In the game, you begin with one ant hill in a vast forest of grass.  There is plenty of good foraging.  And valuable items can be found.  You can grow your colony by building new hills in the openings.  All is well until one day&amp;hellip;..  you encounter&amp;hellip;  OTHER ANTS!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Soon it becomes clear that this is a contest for domination.  You must build an army for defense, and maybe an attack or two.  But you must carefully watch your food supply and the size of your army because of spoilage and fungus plagues. If you can exterminate another colony's home hill or build a great temple hill, all the other colonies will surrender to you and you will be an instant winner. Or if the forest is cleared first, you can win by having the most wealth.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ants 4X is a diceless game.  This gives the players choices instead of relying on luck.  Battles are resolved by secret deployment of soldiers ants, simultaneously revealed.  Of course, the explore actions, by necessity, will involve finding random items.  Everything you find will be useful for something, but you may need to change your strategy.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ants 4X is not an educational or epic game, just a fun, fast playing game that includes all the basic 4X actions, resource management and a dab of ant know-how thrown in for good measure.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
