						               													<description>A press-your-luck card game of sci-fi goodness.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You are the captain of a salvage ship. It isn't glamorous but it is profitable. The salvage of a lifetime just drifted into nearby space. Unfortunately, you're not the only salvage crew to respond. Since you all arrive at the derelict together, interstellar salvage laws apply. Within the ship are dangers and rewards alike, just waiting for you.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In this fast-paced game of risk-taking and decision-making, you and up to four additional players try to claim the most salvage from the derelict ship before its failing engines finally explode. You'll go room to room gathering up salvage and avoiding deadly hazards. Will you get out of the derelict and tuck away your acquired salvage, or press your luck against the growing threat of the deadly hazards?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This game can be played in under 30 minutes and is simple enough to be grasped by young players. Older players, however, will enjoy it even more as they weigh the odds and make their decisions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player is a faction that has an immunity, and the push your luck aspect comes from flipping the top card of the deck.  You can get salvage points that are evenly distributed among the players left on the ship and the left over goes to a kitty.  You can also flip over a hazard, which only kills you the second time a hazard of the same type is revealed.  Before you flip the next card, you have a tile that says, stay, or to back to ship. If you go back to ship, you keep the points that you have gathered and take the kitty points.  If you stay, you keep going until everyone dies or leaves for their ship.  There are five stages of the game.  Each stage you also shuffle an artifact and a black hazard which no one is immune to into the deck.  Each faction also has an artifact that will score them 20 points, whereas if you don't get your special artifact, it is only 10 points.  At the end of the five stages, whoever has the most points wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
