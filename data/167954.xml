			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The BETA Men Need You!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the shadows of World War II, another war is being fought. This is a war the public know nothing about&amp;hellip; a war that threatens all of mankind. Invaders from beyond space have set their sights on our planet, and it&amp;rsquo;s going to take superheroes to stop them!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Only one team of operatives is equipped to handle trouble like this: The BETA Men! A team of special forces dedicated to investigating and countering threats from outside, the BETA men are ready for anything. But they&amp;rsquo;ll need the help of some superheroes to get the job done.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The BETA Men is written by Jack Norris for the Mutants and Masterminds Third Edition Role Playing Game. Artwork is provided by Alex Williamson and Denise Jones. Included you&amp;rsquo;ll find an extensive brief on the Bureau of Extra-Terrestrial Affairs (BETA), summarizing their membership, history, and equipment. Everyone from leader Dash Freeman to the intellectual super-simian Professor Trinazet is given spotlight status with full stat blocks and entries.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Also inside are the guidelines for running an Invasion campaign, breaking everything down into stages. An innovative Victory Point system helps give the players a currency they can use to help determine the course of the campaign.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Finally, we outline three example sets of invaders. Will you confront the Lokkus Horde and their horrifying biotech, the mysterious size-changing threat of the Triffling Empire, or the self-proclaimed  master super-race of Das &amp;Uuml;bermen? You&amp;rsquo;ll find histories, artwork, motives, plot seeds, and artwork for each set of invaders. Each one can be a campaign on their own, or string them together for a mega-sized campaign to save the earth on multiple fronts!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Join forces with the BETA men, and take a stand for all of humanity!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;We&amp;rsquo;re Watching the Skies!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
