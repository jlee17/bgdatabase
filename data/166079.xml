			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Untold millennia ago, an order of holy knights led by a mighty archon battled the daemonic harbinger Shektalmaratu. In an act of heroic sacrifice they sealed Shektalmaratu's profane spirit away within an icy prison. In the wake of ages, these Wardens of the Frozen Flame are now few in number and are besieged in their last remaining keep by the harbinger&amp;rsquo;s loyal servants, the Crusaders of the Shattered Sky. Here within the icy realm known as the Frozen Cage, these two powerful forces of good and evil are locked in a bitter stalemate, waiting for a time when powerful heroes arrive to tip the precarious balance and either aid in defeating the harbinger's minions once and for all, or fall to that evil power and have their very souls consumed to break the bonds holding Shektalmaratu at bay.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Demiplanes are short supplements designed to present the time-crunched GM with an entire demiplane ready to easily insert into virtually any home campaign. Perfect as an adventure locale, the lair of a powerful ally or merely somewhere to occasionally visit for any one of a hundred reason, Demiplanes are the perfect resource for GMs looking for something a little bit different for their campaigns.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
