				<name type="primary" sortindex="1" value="Captoons: The Game of Comic Foreplay and Social Intercourse" />
			
						                           
						               													<description>Captoons is a game for seemingly mature, yet frisky adults, that has been called &amp;ldquo;the most fun you can have with your clothes on!&amp;rdquo;  And it&amp;rsquo;s easy.  Each player simply matches a caption card chosen from their hand to the cartoon in play.  The Card Captain, randomly chosen, then announces what he feels is the funniest pairing.  And that&amp;rsquo;s where the fun really starts.  In a game featuring 450 captions, 80 cartoons and 36,000 possible pairings!!, the Card Captain&amp;rsquo;s choice may be about as popular as a fart in a hermetically sealed space suit, leading to rather spirited and hilarious interactions between the players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
