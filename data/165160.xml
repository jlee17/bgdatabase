			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;We take our first trip back to the Pirate Island this week. We head to the north-east corner of the island where the were-tribes are the ones in charge. Julian, a were-tiger that has arrived from the mainland is trying to unite the tribes and return them to the mainland. This issue we have an extra map from Teo Commons, the usual hooks, history and people round out the package.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
