			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Word has reached your ears that a relic weapon is nearby and at the ruins of Linthar Keep. Once a bastion of humanity the remains of this fortress is now home to roving bands humanoids that have been attacking nearby communities. Can your young adventurer brave the dungeon of the old keep and find the riches others have been unable to&amp;hellip;..the famed SKULLCLEAVER blade!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This adventure setting was designed for 1st/2nd Edition AD&amp;amp;D for the Filbar Campaign for a 3rd - 4th level fighter or cleric and a DM.  Originally this was used for a 4th level cleric (solo) retrieving the SKULLCLEAVER for his order. This adventure is easily adaptable to most any game and system and comes from my original campaign. Save yourself some time and utilize it for a one shot adventure or a continuing campaign!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
