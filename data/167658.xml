			               													<description>From the Introduction:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Here's How It Is...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Earth got used up. We found a new solar system and used terraforming technology to create hundreds of new Earths. The central planets formed the Alliance and decided that all worlds should unite under their rule. There was some disagreement on that point.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After the War for Unification, many Independents- those who fought and lost- drifted to the edges of the system, far from Alliance control. Out on the Rim, people struggle to get by with the most basic technologies. Out here a ship will bring you work. A gun will help you keep it.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A captain's goal is simple: Find a crew. Find a Job. Keep flyin'.&amp;#10; &amp;#10;User Summary:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A fan-created hack of the AGE system to model the Firefly setting. This document assumes use of the rules from Dragon Age RPG, Set 1.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Amongst other information and optional rules, it includes 14 backgrounds, 3 classes (with 3 specializations each), various changes to focuses and talents, and appropriate listings of gear. Also there are rules for starships (including combat in space), and a summary of the key details of the setting. It further includes and a section on GM advice and options, and a range of story hooks.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
