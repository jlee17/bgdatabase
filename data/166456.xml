			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Living in the digital age can be difficult for anyone, even more so if you&amp;rsquo;re just a lowly program. After the defeat of the MCP, the party is betrayed by Hack, who immediately steals the MCP disc and escapes to the net. The party must chase and capture Hack before the grid goes off line; without the MCP&amp;rsquo;s algorithms, however, they must pray to their users for strength. The players themselves will have to intervene at the game table in order to help their programs and catch Hack before the next cycle. Will the users and programs succeed, or will they face the End of Line?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;From Episode 24 - Zombie-Tron&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Description: The Gagmen host a guest, Adam Baillio, for his Kickstarter for making custom LED light up costumes. The adventure is a digital fantasy (you know, like Tron) and the Gagmen give it a pretty good go. Unfortunately it was right back to a zombie horror game, but we got to have a lot of fun with it. Also, enjoy a side dish of meta-gaming with user controls in the form of a hat.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
