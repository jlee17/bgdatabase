						               													<description>This is a card game where players are College Students trying to graduate before the Greedy Billionaire can take away all their money.  They start with a supply of money and will need to pay tuition and other expenses each year (round).  They score points for graduating and for avoiding bankruptcy.  The Greedy Billionaire is not an actual player but he scores points for each College Student that goes bankrupt.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players graduate by playing 4 Pass Exam cards (one each for freshman, sophomore, junior and senior year) and one Graduation card.  In order to obtain enough money to pay tuition, players may play action cards to get a job, earn a scholarship and receive financial aid.  But beware!  Their opponents will play Greedy Billionaire Cards to send their job overseas, raise tuition, cut the education budget, pollute the earth, and accuse them of cheating.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Points are tallied at the end of each hand and the final object is to be the first player to score 150 points in several hands of play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
