			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;Oh, how super-scrumptious, Hank. Tonight we live!&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;She's the queen of jukeboxes and hi-jinx, and now she's back!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Among the many genres that thrived during the Golden Age of Comics was the teen comedy, sometimes with romantic elements, sometimes not. One example of these was Standard's Kathy, a series that lasted eight epidodes in the anthology series Thrilling Comics and eventually being awarded its own title in 1954.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Kathy was at its best in the earliest episodes, with stories fast-paced stories that read like modern-day television sit-coms ahd which are blessed with art superior to almost any other teen comedy strips, as it was by the dream team of Frank Frazetta and Ralph Mayo.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;NUELOW Games' Kathy collects all four of the Frazetta/Mayo-illustrated episodes in one place. The book may be of special interest to those like to examine the techinical aspects of comic book art, as Mayo and Frezaetta handle different aspects of the art on different stories.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In addition to the classic comics, Kathy includes a complete supplement for ROLF!: The Rollplaying Game of Big Dumb Fifghters. It features a story in which Kathy meets actress Linda Turner (secretly the Black Cat), four battle scenarios, seven pre-generated characters, and a selection of Traits and Battle Maneuvers not included in the main rulebook.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
