						               													<description>Get ready for a card game that makes all other forms of entertainment look like deadwood!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The cards are dealt. You pass on the up-card and draw from the stock. Two melds already and you&amp;rsquo;ve only drawn once! Sort the high cards down and discard that king. Not much deadwood, but if you knock now, you might get undercut. It&amp;rsquo;s risky either way, but you hang in there, hoping for a spade or a seven.&amp;#10;One more draw&amp;hellip;and&amp;hellip;GIN!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Cast of Characters&amp;#10;Want to play Gin Rummy against an elegant Victorian skunk? We&amp;rsquo;ve got you covered. How about a dapper beaver in a collar and waistcoat? You can do that too. With 11 different animated characters to choose from, including a variety of well dressed ladies and gentlemen (and equally well dressed farm animals and robots), our cast of quirky characters will charm the aces out of you.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gameplay For All Skill Levels&amp;#10;If you&amp;rsquo;re new to Gin Rummy, don&amp;rsquo;t worry. The EASY difficulty setting is a great way to ease into the game. If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for more of a challenge, HARD will have you planning every move and really watching the discards. Whatever your skill level, our adjustable difficulty system has the right setting for you.&amp;#10;Traditional Scoring&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Games in Gin Rummy can be customized to be played to 100 (if you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a quick game), 150, 250 or 300 (if you&amp;rsquo;d like a game that lasts a bit longer). Scoring follows classic rules with a 100 point bonus for winning, a 20 point bonus for each hand won, and double points for shutting out your opponent!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Source: The Developer Website.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
