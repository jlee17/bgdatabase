			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is where the saga begins. Toys will grow out many unusual things, but this is where it starts. This is where the fighting librarians from Ethos set out. This is where the Orc Queen takes the first step on her march to the Peace Bringer. Right here in Toys Volume I, this is the roots of all of it, of all the published issues and of those still expanding in the pod. In a saga writ large and ongoing a philosophy of the dice begins to develop and it all starts to make sense. And it&amp;rsquo;s never written in stone. It&amp;rsquo;s for you to play God with. Pick up some Toys. Scatter the pieces. Take each chapter and mold it with the secret stuff that&amp;rsquo;s only known to you. That&amp;rsquo;s the way this world works. Live it.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Toys. The Omni. Issues 1-18. A good deal of fun.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
