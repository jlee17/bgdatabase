						               													<description>Airships vs Aliens is a quick strategy boardgame for two players, with one player defending the Earth with ten Steampunk Airship miniatures, while the opposing player attempts to win the invasion using ten alien ship miniatures. The game is pure strategy with no luck elements involved.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each side has 5 Gunships, 3 Warships and 2 Commandships. The first player to eliminiate both opposing Commandships wins. Each turn a player takes actions with one piece. An action is moving one square forward in the direction facing, turning the ship 90 degrees or firing the long range guns. Gunships have no long range guns, Warships have them with a range of 1 square forward and Commandship long guns can fire with a range of 2 squares forward. Gunships have up to 4 actions when moved, Warships have 3 and Commandships have 2.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To deepen the strategy each side has 5 command tokens that one can be used during a turn to give a ship an extra action. Another strategy element is that when you lose Warships or Commandships you may be able to bring a destroyed ship back to board as reinforcements.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
