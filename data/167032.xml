			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Goblins, gnolls, thouls, ghouls, skeletons, trolls, ogres, orcs, worgs and worse forced to live and work together by an evil Master who could be a Dragon, Necromancer or even a Warlord of their own stock.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It used to be better in the shining copper age of legend but then we were cast down by the Sunlovers to this.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Now this is what we&amp;rsquo;ve got: you sleep in water and filth; you get some rotten biscuits to eat if you&amp;rsquo;re lucky; you only get to go outside so the Sunlover Butchers can kill you; the only weapon you have is a rusty knife; all your so-called allies are all on &amp;lsquo;The List&amp;rsquo;; and the Master&amp;rsquo;s enforcers whip you if you complain.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;But you can fight back! Raiders sneak across the ploughed cuts the Earthcutting Sunlovers make in their fields toloot and pillage their farms. Marauders charge in and cut down Forestlurkers before they can sing their cursing song. Thieves sneak in quietly behind the Goldkissing Longbeards and snatch their purses as they slit their throats. Harriers rush in and stealthe food off the table and are back out the door before the Fatbelly Hairytoes can swallow their mouthful and scream. Extortionists sit back quietly and rake in the valuables from their scams. Shamans curse them all with the powers of secrets and fire.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is what we&amp;rsquo;ve got, yes. But what are you going to take and hide for yourself?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
