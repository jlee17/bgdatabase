			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Evil may sleep, but it does not die. It may lie dormant for a time, but it rarely, if ever, admits to defeat. So much blood has been spilled in the age-old feud between man and monster&amp;mdash;one might imagine the endless crimson flow could slake the thirst of even the eldest vampire master. The wise look to the lightning on the horizon and know better. The twisted embodiments of evil are forever hungry, forever hateful, and forever desiring to conquer the so-called civilized world and extinguish its light. Join the eternal battle as it rages on in a new age of hideous magic, heroic might, and mad science!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Monster Hunters is a horror roleplaying game that takes place in Edwardian Europe. This is a game of gothic terror, set in a world where the realistic and the fantastic merge in horrifying ways. This is a setting rife with grotesque characters, bizarre events, and macabre situations. In this world, the dead stalk the streets of the living, strange creatures hunger for human flesh, and dark forces barter for mortal souls. The players take on the role of extraordinary men and women who investigate, track down, and battle against a rising tide of hideous monstrosities. This game uses the Pathfinder rules system and requires the Pathfinder Core Rulebook to play. The information provided in this book exists to give players the tools they need to create characters who fight supernatural evil in the early 20th century.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
