			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Cold and dark and ghosts are converging. Toys #91 is the story of one such weary spirit who has sobbed for centuries deep in Weeping Wood. It all began with lovers falling into a sinkhole. Maybe he survived. She surely didn&amp;rsquo;t and has not paused from weeping. The sinkhole is not just any sinkhole - there&amp;rsquo;s probably a Demon King connection. But more immediately? Danger from an ugly little self-made construct pieced together of dead wood and old bits of dog. Psychic Penelope thinks she can calm things down and lay the girl&amp;rsquo;s spirit to rest. But first she needs someone to gather the girl&amp;rsquo;s scattered bones (the suitor&amp;rsquo;s too) then bring a cleric and she will stage a wedding. It&amp;rsquo;s worth a try. Pack some Demon Dog Bones - a good first line attack - and some Red Willow Bark Potion. And the wedding present. Don&amp;rsquo;t forget that.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
