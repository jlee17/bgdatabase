			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Huddled behind an ancient breakwater of unknown provenance and hemmed in by dense woodlands, the pirate stronghold of Deksport is an isolated, violent place. Orcs and goblins openly walk the streets among the human inhabitants and serve on the many predatory vessels sailing from the port. Built upon the ruins of an old logging town swept away long ago in a tide of blood and slaughter great quantities of loot, treasure and slaves flows through the dilapidated, ruined port. Ruled by a loose coalition of three powerful, vicious and depraved co-rulers, Deksport is a nest of suffering, self-interest and barely restrained racial violence. Each of the three co-rulers plots ceaselessly against their peers, working to become the undisputed lord of the pirates and thus the town perpetually teeters on the edge of bloodshed and chaos. With nearby kingdoms growing increasingly angry with the pirates&amp;rsquo; depredations, the call has gone out for brave adventurers to crush the pirate threat once and for all.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Town Backdrops are short, richly detailed supplements that each present a single town ready to insert into almost any home campaign. Perfect for use as a waystop on the road to adventure, as an adventure site themselves or as a PC&amp;rsquo;s home, Town Backdrop present the details so the busy GM can focus on crafting exciting, compelling adventures.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
