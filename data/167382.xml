						               													<description>User Summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A simple pond simulation, Pollywog has you living the life of frogs. You start the game with a dozen eggs that hatch into a school of pollywogs (tadpoles). Control the school with the joystick and eat the algae. As the pollywogs eat they slowly mature into frogs. Avoid the orange creepies and the great white fish. They eat pollywogs and frogs, But frogs can eat the creepies as well.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Eating all the algae in the pond or eating all the creepies will advance you to another pond. There are 64 ponds and you'll advance as many pond as there are pollywogs left. If you have 10 pollywogs after the first pond, you'll advance to pond #11.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
