			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Among the fens and moors of the north is a meadow where it is always the first day of summer. Those travelers lucky enough to come upon this magical place report finding three magic wells on a hill. What they don&amp;rsquo;t usually talk about is the fairy folk who live in the meadow. Since the fairy magic tends to cloud the minds of those who do find the meadow most can never find their way back. Rather than admit their error legend claims that the wells wander around the moor.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Wandering Wells of Mistmoor will serve you well in any fantasy game you are playing where you need a quick scene to add a bit of color or new adventure opportunists.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
