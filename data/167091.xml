						               													<description>A HYBRID OF HORROR-SURVIVAL AND CREEPYPASTA...&amp;#10;Finally, a horror adventure game that's more story than gory... that gives you rich dialogue, complex characters and atmospheric setting at the same time as it takes away violence as your only way out.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;Huntsman: The Orphanage&amp;quot; is an indie 3D first-person horror-mystery game, where your only equipment is your smartphone and your only weapon is your wits.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Explore the old Orphanage buildings and grounds as you investigate the legend of The Huntsman and discover the truth of the children's disappearances, but beware of Huntsman himself - he still stalks the hallways and his embrace is inescapable.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Find the lost orphan, Charley and ensure he survives, so you and your ancestors can continue to exist in this present thread of time and space you know as your reality!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;We've gone out on a limb here at Shadowshifters to build this game on a foundation of diversity, inclusiveness, and above all story - the characters' own stories. Rather than centering the premise upon a single (white male) character, Huntsman: The Orphanage provides 19 distinct personalities to learn more about in-game, and each has his or her own dark past, experiences and motivations. A fallen, alcoholic womanizing priest; a creepy matron who isn't as altruistic and she'd like to think she is; a mad cook with an imaginary baby - or is it; a Jewish deaf-mute boy who sees and hears more than anyone; a sickly asthmatic who is forced out to the fringes; a suicidally remorseful Scottish caretaker who finally makes the hardest decision of all after 40 years of guilt; a teenage drama queen who lives in a perpetual land of &amp;quot;me myself I&amp;quot;; and a total of 9 different ethnicities including African-American, Italian, Asian, New Zealander, Scandinavian, Irish, &amp;amp; a creature from another dimension entirely!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Source: The Developer Website.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
