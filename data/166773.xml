						               													<description>User Summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Apples to Apples is a very simple game where a variable amount of players take turns choosing green apple cards with adjectives on them such as &amp;ldquo;explosive&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;repulsive&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;loud&amp;rdquo;. All the other players then choose from a hand of seven red apple cards with all sorts of words which endeavor to be like that green card, ranging from actions such as &amp;ldquo;running&amp;rdquo; to people like &amp;ldquo;Leonardo DeVinci&amp;rdquo;. The goal is to match the green card with a red card as best as possible, but Apples to Apples has always been a party game and party games love house rules, so some players may not play by the book. The XBLA version introduces a single player feature as well as a different variant to the game&amp;rsquo;s multiplayer, but at its core this is a game of comparisons.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
