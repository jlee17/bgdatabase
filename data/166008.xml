						               													<description>When a travelling lady-of-the-night finds herself running out of fuel on the way to the Big City, she discovers more than she bargained for in this gruesome gas-station. Relying on her wits and the help of her best friend and crack-fiend, Susie the Drug Addict, things start to go from &amp;ldquo;bad&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;weird&amp;rdquo; as she must not only find vital fuel for her car, but also put a stop to an armed robbery, defeat an ancient and evil (but extremely polite) cult, and show a young man that becoming a hippy is never the right answer. Can she fulfil the prophecy, and uncover the mystery of &amp;ndash; THE PERFIDIOUS PETROL STATION?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The timeless story of a young woman needing gasoline, and nowehere near the giant leap backwards for womens' rights you may think it is! Coming from a tradition of naughty humour and dodgy puns in adventure stretching back as far as &amp;quot;Leisure Suit Larry&amp;quot;, Nancy's first adventure is a nostalgic romp into the kind of surreal story that only exists within adventure games.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Featuring: &amp;#10;- Non-linear art!&amp;#10;- Fully-voiced comedy adventure with a talented multinational cast&amp;#10;- Disturbing social commentary on the issues of modern womanhood!&amp;#10;- Two languages: English and German!&amp;#10;- Two-to-three hours of comedy adventure!&amp;#10;- Surreal humour and dry British wit&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Source: The Developer Website.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
