			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The elven village of Star Run Falls basks under the spray of the mighty waterfall, the Star Run. Thousands of fireflies hover nightly along the plunging waterfall, their blinking lights appearing as a cascade of flowing stars. The elves of Star Run Falls welcome visitors from all over who come to marvel at the sight of the waterfall and the river brings merchants to trade with. However, the long lived elves are facing sudden and rapid changes to their idyllic lives. Recent goblin activity forced a contingent of human refugees to seek solace within the village. The fast paced human lifestyle often clashes with the timeless elves who struggle with accepting the humans in their midst. Worse yet, an evil rumour darkens the surrounding forest- the dreaded Crimson Shadow King, an evil creature said to appear in the predawn hours, arriving on a chorus of chirping crickets to steal away elven babes for his growing goblinoid army. Additionally, unbeknownst to the villagers, a princess, fleeing an arraigned marriage, hides in the village with her &amp;ldquo;grandfather&amp;rdquo;- a legendary creature that serves as her guardian.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
