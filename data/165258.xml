			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Astral Star has been caught between planes of reality, muddling up cause and effect for years. Now it&amp;rsquo;s crashed in Water City, or at least parts of it have ended up in the river there and gotten turned into a Tavern in the Sky. Poor Emma. She was innocently getting a squeeze on with a local boy, but now she&amp;rsquo;s become a remote viewing device playing an ancient instrument that fell with the Star parts. Jurlamon&amp;rsquo;s on his way. He thinks the Astral Star is really his baby. Maybe. But it&amp;rsquo;s hard to pinpoint. Earths got the 24 hour thing going with a sun-moon-stars setup, so how can the Astral Star ever get stable enough to stay put? Lots of questions. Play it out. See if there&amp;rsquo;s an answer.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
