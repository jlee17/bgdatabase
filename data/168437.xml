A one-page &amp;ldquo;How to Play&amp;rdquo; section is on the next page, followed by a page of Basic Moves, several playbooks for PCs and some resources for the MC. The MC&amp;rsquo;s resources include pages of notes for villains and environments along with a map of Baron Blade&amp;rsquo;s Mobile Defense Platform. Throughout these notes, I have included artwork and descriptions from various sources for inspiration.  card game into roleplaying.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
