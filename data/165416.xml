						               													<description>Lifeless Planet is a 2014 puzzle platformer video game developed by independent company Stage 2 Studios and published by Lace Mamba Global and KISS. The game was released on June 6, 2014 for Microsoft Windows and on June 23, 2014 for OS X, and is currently being ported to the Xbox One. Lifeless Planet was in development since 2011 and is primarily the product of the one developer: David Board.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gameplay&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Lifeless Planet was partly inspired by Cold War sci-fi B movies.&amp;#10;The game contains platforming adventure and puzzles to solve. Levels in the game are linear. The gameplay difficulty increases as the game progresses to match up with the player's skills learned from playing the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Plot&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game follows a scientist on a trip to another planet that is thought to be filled with lifeforms. The mission is a failure as the ship is lost in the crash, the protagonist is unable to locate other crew members, and the planet turns out to be an enormous wasteland completely devoid of life; however, among the vast emptiness is a derelict Soviet Union science outpost constructed on the planet. The game follows the scientist as he explores the planet and figures out how the Soviets managed to travel to the planet, and why the outpost is now empty.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Lifeless Planet&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
