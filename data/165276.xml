			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Underwater demon-cats make for serious trouble in #85. Take note of Rakshasa Murgrow there and be forewarned. Replete with gills and fins and webbing, he&amp;rsquo;s dangerous. See the coral beads threaded in his bushy mane? He&amp;rsquo;s proud too, and beautiful. His city-craft crashed Toys world unnoticed centuries ago. Now time and population have stacked up and the powerful cats are emerging into Toys reality. So, everybody, it&amp;rsquo;s time to kick the gears of history once again. Get the demon-cats out of here! Put some sailor&amp;rsquo;s tokens in your pockets so you&amp;rsquo;ll always have enough to eat and drink. Then dive down in. There&amp;rsquo;s a rift generator there and see that spire? It&amp;rsquo;s really a guidance fin. Fix them both, then blast the cats back outside of time and space. Further if you can. That should fix &amp;lsquo;em. Space between worlds is the only place for them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
