						               													<description>W.W.B Trivia was one of a number of games that was to go in the W.W.B Deluxe Set that never got published.  It is a trivia game that added another element to W.W.B.  In the game, players would have to answer a trivia question when they landed on a space, before they rolled the die to see if they stayed.  If they answered wrong, they failed and went back to start.  The trivia questions were basic math problems.  Examples of the questions consisted of, when a player landed on the 1 space being asked what 1+0 was, and when landing on the 5 space being asked what 2+3 was.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
