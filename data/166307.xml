						               													<description>You wake up, your flat is a mess, you have a terrible hangover, sounds of the city and police sirens outside. Another day in in a life of Caroline Wells and her dull, corporate job. You get up, thinking that this is going to be just another day on your downward spiral, but what lies ahead are a series of life changing, cathartic experiences.&amp;#10;  &amp;#10;&amp;#10;     4PM is a short, interactive drama, where you lead a character through several different scenes/locations during a day, adding to a bigger story&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;* 4PM is a high production value, cinematic experience aimed at people interested in interactive story-telling, but without the complexities and reflex based natures of classic games&amp;#10; * 4PM doesn&amp;rsquo;t have an inventory system, health bars, or any other distracting elements, it pulls you into this story and puts you in the shoes of the character. You are Caroline, you live her day, and your decisions which will change the outcome of the game&amp;#10; * 4PM will try to create an interesting blend between linear, cinematic stories and interactive gameplay&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Source: The Game Website.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
