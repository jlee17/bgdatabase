			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Over the years the city by the sea has grown from a fishing village to a thriving port and a center of power along the western cost. It has also become a center for learning with the establishment of the Royal University one hundred and fifty years ago. Today the university is in the midst of trying times, the School of Theology is on the verge of a war led by the followers of &amp;ldquo;the Five&amp;rdquo;, a war that could take the city with it. The History School on the other hand is thriving and consistently recovering the knowledge of the past.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
