						               													<description>User Summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;An educational trivia game published in the same year as the first manned landing on the Moon. A race to be the first to visit the Moon and return, players answer trivia questions about general science and the Apollo mission to move their golf tee pawns around the Moon and back to Earth. Progressive rules are provided to allow for play by novice astronauts.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Publisher's Box-Back Description&amp;#10;&amp;#10;APOLLO is more than a game, it is an encyclopedic work devised to acquaint adults and young people with some of the fundamentals involved in a voyage to the Moon and facts about subjects such as geography, astronomy, units of measurement and practical physics.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The principle of the game is for each player to pilot his Apollo spacecraft from Cape Kennedy to a landing on the Moon and return to the good Earth with a sample of the lunar surface.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Dice are used to tell a player how far to move across the board on each play, providing he doesn't encounter a flight problem during a critical maneuver. There are 270 questions (with answers) which are used to overcome these problems. Typical maneuvers include landing on the Moon, re-docking the Lunar Module with the Command Module and Earth re-entry.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game will add useful information to each player's bank of knowledge whether he is a fourth or fifth grade student or a professional person in a technology. The unique design of the game allows persons of these different ages and experiences to play the game together with the same degree of challenge and interest for each player. This variable level of play allows the less experienced to progress as they become better acquainted with man's space accomplishments and other topics.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;We're sure you'll enjoy our approach to provide excitement and challenge with practical educational material.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
