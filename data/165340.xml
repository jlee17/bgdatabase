			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Storm Elves made the Iron Dragon then lost the key and he was free. He finagled his own free will, then enjoyed a dragonous life amassing hoards of wealth in cahoots with a crew of troll guards. But wait! An elven minx (up to no good) tossed in a game changer. She found the dragon key and plans to use it. The Godslayer, that malignant sage, wants it too and seers throughout the world are watching the key rippling their worlds of prophecy. What&amp;rsquo;s up and what&amp;rsquo;s down in this adventure? Support the Iron Dragon? The Seer of Pirate Island? Are the Storm Elves the good guys in this new chapter? Even the elf girl and the trolls want your help. Play it by ear or the seat of your pants &amp;ndash; the rules are murky. You&amp;rsquo;re on The Pinky. It&amp;rsquo;s the Drowning Man Mountains. You&amp;rsquo;re on your own.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
