			               													<description>Publisher's blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Every choice has a consequence.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Your character can be a beacon of hope and justice in dark and dangerous world, or cultivate a soul so black that angels hide their faces in fear. Whichever way you prefer to play, this book will provide you with the rules, resources, and inspiration to take perhaps the most maligned and misunderstood aspect of the game and make it a vital part of the roleplay experience once more. Within these pages, age-old questions are answered and new powers are unlocked for those willing to take a stand for Good or Evil, Law or Chaos... and even for those who choose to remain scrupulously Neutral. New dangers await also: threats which go beyond loss of life and limb and which can imperil your character's very soul!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
