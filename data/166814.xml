			               													<description>From the Introduction:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It is 1874. You are an outrider for a wagon train heading out West to California. You and your team have been hired to see these families in their prairie schooners through to their dreams of riches and freedom that the untamed wilderness offers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Wagon trains were mobile communities, families, artisans and politicians. Like any other community it had its fair share of drama. You are now part of the drama that played out with each wagon train that tried its luck out West...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Wagons Ho! is inspired by cowboy/western movies and shows from the 50's-60's, so historical accuracy is considered, but sometimes completely discarded. If you want to play this up as an F-Troop comedy style game or as John Ford style epic is entirely up to the GM's discretion.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
