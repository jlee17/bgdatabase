			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Hey, you - watch out! That&amp;rsquo;s the Wreckers&amp;rsquo; Wall in front of you. You might have heard it&amp;rsquo;s the most free place in the world, but just don&amp;rsquo;t think that means you can cruise right in. Warden Hastings is waiting for you, crafty as 10,000 cats and quick with a blade. You hear that ugly sobbing, like weeping, like pain? That&amp;rsquo;s the Outcorloig, a monster for sure, bred out of parts strewn around after a battle. Careful! He bites big. Wreckers&amp;rsquo; Wall? Yes, it does get billed as the most free place in the world, but make sure you&amp;rsquo;re ready for this much freedom. And, by the way, look sharp stern side. These guys are free enough to cut a hole right in the side of your ship&amp;hellip;g god. It looks like war! War coming to The City By the Sea&amp;hellip;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
