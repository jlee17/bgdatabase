			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;THE JUNGLE IS NO PLACE FOR BEASTS LIKE YOU!&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Raised by her misanthrope of a naturalist father to feel more kinship with the animals of the African jungle than with other humans, young Judy champions wildlife and the wilderness along the Yazoo River. She only fully trusts Pistol Roberts, an American ranger. Her general distrust of humanity serves her well, as she finds herself the target of a corrupt big game hunter and comes into conflict with a former circus freak with dreams of building a jumgle empire in this second volume of &amp;quot;Judy of the Jungle&amp;quot; tales from NUELOW Games.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Judy of the Jugle: Warriors of Laughing Hyena features four great comics adventures--three by the character's creator Ralph Mayo, and one by the legendary Frank Frazetta--and two short stories by Charles S. Strong. Additionally, the book contains more rules for use with OGL d20 Modern jungle-based roleplaying games, like those found in the fist book in this series, July of the Jungle: The Lords of Memnon.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;Judy of the Jungle&amp;quot; was originally published by Nedor Comics, debuting as a secondary feature in Exciting Comics in 1947. She was featured in 15 short comics stories, and five fiction pieces. Judy's adventures hold up better than many of the entries in the &amp;quot;jungle girl&amp;quot; genre, which thrived in the pages of comics during the 1940s and early 1950s, including the famous Sheena. We hope that you'll find yourself enjoying these classic tales as much as we here at NUELOW Games do.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
