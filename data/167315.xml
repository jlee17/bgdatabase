						               													<description>A journey to an environmental disaster that holds many secrets&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Residue is a story-driven 2D platform adventure in which you control three characters with different abilities, exploring an abandoned excavation site in the remains of the Aral Sea in present-day Uzbekistan. Once the fourth largest lake in the world, the Aral Sea is now an arid wasteland, a victim of decades of Soviet cotton irrigation. To some, it is the prime example for humanity to stay out of nature's business. To others, it's a world waiting to be saved.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After a year of additional polish, taking all of the feedback we've received on the original release into account and making tons of the changes we previously didn't have the means to, we're satisfied to call this the Final Cut.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Source: The Developer Website.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
