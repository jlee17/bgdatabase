			               													<description>Publisher's blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Whether you prefer to roleplay as an elven scout bounding through the forest on a fleet-footed stag, a dwarven barbarian charging fearlessly into battle on the back of a sturdy war-ram, or a shining knight in armor atop his mighty charger, this book will help you to bring these iconic characters to life in new ways. This book features new, expanded rules for using mounts in combat, new uses for the Ride skill, new actions in combat for mounted characters, as well as a bestiary with new options allowing your mounts to scale with your character's level. New feats, spells, and magic items specifically geared for use by mounts and mounted characters are included as well.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
