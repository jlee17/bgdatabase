			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The steel chair crashes against your back with a thunderous clap, and the crowd&amp;rsquo;s roar signals you to drop and pretend you&amp;rsquo;re out. As El Diablo turns his back to signal his victory, you make your move. He never sees your finisher coming. The crowd counts with along with the referee, &amp;ldquo;1! 2! 3!&amp;rdquo; and victory is yours. You rise from the mat and raise your new championship belt overhead to an arena going mad.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Professional wrestling is scripted, but it is not fake. The money, fame, and glory are all very real, and the belts still go to those who work hardest: in the gym, on the microphone, in the ring. But some work&amp;mdash;maybe most&amp;mdash;the fans will never see. The underhanded backroom deals, the chemicals that performers pump into their bodies, the backstabbings that aren&amp;rsquo;t a part of any angle. It takes a lot to get to the top, and a lot of people are fighting for it.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;So hold your new championship belt high. You earned it.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
