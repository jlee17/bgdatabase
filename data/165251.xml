			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The locals called it the Medusa Sanctuary, but that was always sort of a colloquialism.  If you capture medusas and dissect them and lock them up, is that sanctuary? Well, maybe not. If you bundle them all up and send them off to their own homeland, is that freeing them? That&amp;rsquo;s an improvement Aaron Alfast thinks and says a resounding &amp;ldquo;yes&amp;rdquo; to giving them their own flag. But the real decider is going to be Amoriliath, the Medusa Queen. She may have to square off against a mage controlled double, but put your faith in her. She wants to be free and she wants her daughters to be free. She&amp;rsquo;s powerful and the do-gooders are on her side. But what about you? Can sentient beings be monsters? Pick a side. Just mind your eyes. Bring a mirror. Maybe a back-up.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
