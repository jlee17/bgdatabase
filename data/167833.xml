			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Uncover Forgotten Arcane Lore!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Everyone knows that knowledge is power, and that having options is better than not having them. It should come as no surprise, then, that wizards, witches, and other powerful spellcasters are always on the lookout for new and exciting spells to add to their repertoires. While many spells from the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook received a facelift and an upgrade in Mythic Adventures, the sourcebook that introduced mythic power to the game of Pathfinder, dozens of spells were left behind. Missing Mythic Magic Volume XI, and its predecessors, aim to give each and every spell from the core rules a full-fledged mythic upgrade, all the way from A to Z, with a special focus on making mythic spells that feel as over-the-top and larger-than-life as possible.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This installment includes 20 mythic spells, from heroes&amp;rsquo; feast to imprisonment. A mythic hide from animals can ward an entire area against animals, rather than affecting individuals, and expands the spell to work on magical beasts, plants, oozes, and vermin. A mythic hold person can be rendered permanent (if the DC is high enough), effectively paralyzing the victim indefinitely, while a mythic horrid wilting causes the desiccated corpses of those that it slays to rise a mummies under the caster&amp;rsquo;s control. This tome contains all that, and much, much more!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
