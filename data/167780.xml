						               													<description>Paper Toss is a fast, fun, new card game where players compete to deliver the most newspapers on their paper route.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Paper Toss can be played by 2 to 6 players in anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes (more players make longer games), and the rules are simple and easy to learn, suitable for ages 5 and up.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The comical art and theme, coupled with the silly, competitive nature of the game make it great for younger children and even the whole family.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Draw cards from the blue &amp;quot;Paper Deck,&amp;quot; and take turns trying to toss your newspaper on a new doormat (by playing the &amp;quot;Paper Toss&amp;quot; card), as other players try to throw off your aim with hazards like angry dogs, sidewalk obstacles, and neighborhood kids. If you have the appropriate counter card, you can ignore the distraction.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A simple discard mechanic adds a subtle layer of strategy: choose which cards to hold or discard, keeping your defensive cards, or going on the offense. Wild cards like &amp;quot;Flat Tire!&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Bully!&amp;quot; help you stick it to your opponent and gain an upper hand.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once you throw your paper, turn over a card from the green &amp;quot;Toss Deck,&amp;quot; to see how good your throw was. With every successful paper toss, you gain a Paper Token. The first player to collect 10 Tokens wins the game! Can you be the first one to toss all your papers?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
