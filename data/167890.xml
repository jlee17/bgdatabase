			               													<description>publisher blurb&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ten years ago we launched Castles &amp;amp; Crusades the RPG. We officially debuted the game at Gencon with a collectors set designed after the original white box of Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons. We did this to celebrate that game's 30th anniversary.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ten years later the game is growing stronger and faster than ever and we are happily celebrating our 10th anniversary.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To bring it in properly we present to you the 4010 Collectors Edition of Castles &amp;amp; Crusades, the Black Box. 10 years of C&amp;amp;C. 40 years of D&amp;amp;D. Its a wonderful world.&amp;#10; There are only 1000 printed.&amp;#10; The first 300 are signed and numbered.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Within are 3 books, 10 dice (four d6's with Castles and Crusades replacing the number 6), a small bit of company history, three cards that trace the evolution of the original company logo. These are all signed by the creators of TLG and C&amp;amp;C: Stephen Chenault, Davis Chenault and Mac Golden.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10; &amp;#10;The three books:&amp;#10; Adventurer's Backpack: Four new classes: The Archer, Avatar, Magic User and Thief. Original takes on old classes! Each of the new classes is fully detailed and playable out of the box. These are followed by four ready made adventurer's backpacks, with equipment cataloged and stored, with cost and EV attached. These are followed by 36+ spells, all new, all ready to hit your table right now!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Of Gods &amp;amp; Monsters of Aihrde: Details on 16 or more gods, 5 giants, 5 eldritch goblins, 4 fiends and one of the Captain Kings. Each entry places the god or monster squarely in the world of Aihrde, fully playable with adventure hooks. But these are no ordinary giants and fiends. The giants are named as are the goblins, each with their own sorry tale. The fiends are wholly new to C&amp;amp;C, designed to aid CKs who need to bring characters to their senses!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Golden Familiar: Revised and expanded. This adventure originally appeared as an add on with the portrait screens. Now we've cleaned it up and added 14 maps. The adventure pitches the characters a hill top castle whose 14 gates guard the only access to the treasure within.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
