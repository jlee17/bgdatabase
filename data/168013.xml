						               													<description>Help your team guess the twisted words by describing and acting them out! The humor of Cards Against Humanity meets the style of Taboo.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;How to play:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1. Split your group into two teams. One player starts first.&amp;#10;2. On your turn, draw a rule card. This rule applies to you during your turn. &amp;#10;3. Then, draw a twisted card. Get your team members to guess the word on your card. Describe it. Act it out. Just don&amp;rsquo;t read out the restricted words in the middle of the card. &amp;#10;4. If your team guesses the word, your team keeps that card. Keep drawing twisted cards until your 60-second turn ends. Then, it&amp;rsquo;s the other team&amp;rsquo;s turn.&amp;#10;5. Keep playing until everyone has a turn. The team that has the most cards at the end wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
