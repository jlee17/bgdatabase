						               													<description>About the game&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Sense&amp;iuml; is the undisputed chieftain. His followers are used to every martial, extortion and infiltration practices. Pony and Biki are his best students, his true pride.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This duet masters the chakra technique on the fingertips and hoofs. Together, they rule on the city and its surroundings. Although everyone respects and fears them, they are hunted by the law enforcement.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;They are Ninjas.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Crouching Pony Hidden Dragon is an Action/RPG type of game, totally novel and initially developed for SNK&amp;rsquo;s Neo-Geo console.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Under his false look of simple arcade game, CPHD hides a persistent world of rich and various rules, where &amp;quot;run&amp;rsquo;n gun&amp;quot; mechanics like Shock Troopers or Ninja commando, mix themselves with playful &amp;quot;RPG&amp;quot; ones, like in Zelda or Secret of Mana. Indeed, in CPHD, you absolutely have to explore every level to find the necessary resources for your progression (life bonus, resurrection potion or special Ninja techniques). Treasure chests are hidden everywhere. You&amp;rsquo;ll have to find them to afford equipment upgrades in the shops. By confronting your enemies, you&amp;rsquo;ll win some experience points that will make you level up and become stronger.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Be careful, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to use your life and money resources wisely as they are limited and if you don&amp;rsquo;t prepare yourself and your armor, you highly risk going through a hard time.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Try to play in Cooperation mode, it&amp;rsquo;s even more fun and strategic. The resources number remaining the same, will you know how to share?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Good adventure!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Source: The Publisher Website.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
