						               													<description>Like previous DCS World titles, DCS: Bf 109 K-4 Kurf&amp;uuml;rst features a painstakingly reproduced model of the aircraft, including the external model, fully interactive cockpit, mechanical systems, and a Professional Flight Model (PFM). Along the lines of our DCS: P-51D Mustang and DCS: Fw 190 D-9 Dora titles, DCS: Bf 109K-4 Kurf&amp;uuml;rst places you behind the controls of a powerful, propeller-driven, piston engine combat aircraft. Designed long before &amp;ldquo;fly-by-wire&amp;rdquo; technology was available to assist the pilot in flight control or smart bombs and beyond visual range missiles were developed to engage targets with precision from afar, the Kurf&amp;uuml;rst is a personal and exhilarating challenge to master. Powerful and deadly, the last production model of the only single-engined German fighter to see service throughout World War II, the Kurf&amp;uuml;rst provides an exhilarating combat experience to its drivers, and a worthy challenge to all fans of DCS: P-51D Mustang.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Key Features of the DCS: Bf 109 K-4 Kurf&amp;uuml;rst:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Unmatched flight physics that allow you to truly feel what it's like to fly this legend.&amp;#10;    Highly detailed, six-degrees-of-freedom (6 DOF) cockpit.&amp;#10;    Interact with cockpit controls with your mouse.&amp;#10;    Accurate Bf 109 K-4 model, squadron markings, and weapons.&amp;#10;    Detailed modelling the Bf 109 K-4 instruments, weapons, engine, radios, fuel, and electrical systems.&amp;#10;    Fly along with fellow DCS: Fw 190 D-9 Doras as you battle DCS: P-51D Mustangs in single and multiplayer games.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Source: The Game Website.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
