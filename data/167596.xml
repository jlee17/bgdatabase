			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is the first of a series of a variety of ideas that just haven't fit anywhere else. I'm calling the series &amp;quot;Sparks&amp;quot; so they may spark someone's imagination to use them in their games.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Smiler has the creep factor cranked up to eleven as he saunters into a sleepy, unsuspecting town to slowly drain happiness from its people drop by drop. Included is a brief description, a particularly spooky picture courtesy of the Terrible Portraits Project from Jeff Preston, and a collection of ten things that he might be smiling about at any given time.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;He is sure to ruin the happiest day of your PCs in any world he may show up in. Just be sure not to leave him out of his cage for too long or you might have a world nobody wants to live in!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
