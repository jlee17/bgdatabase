			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Godslayer got imprisoned on Pirate Island when he killed the God That Never Was. Now he&amp;rsquo;s a soothsayer fishing on a pier and pulling strings to manipulate the future. He&amp;rsquo;s got times and dates and players finagled into place. The result? He&amp;rsquo;ll set himself free, he hopes. His latest ploy is the Gold Fields scam with an amiable dwarf poised to stumble on gold at Mt. Holy Wall. The old seer&amp;rsquo;s got it all ready. It&amp;rsquo;s all set. And it&amp;rsquo;s a go! There&amp;rsquo;s no avoiding this Gold Rush. But Sherile is working for the other side - the mages and the Woodsman. She&amp;rsquo;s posing as an assayer and stymieing the miners and the Godslayer as well. Her job is to keep the world steady on course. So step up. Pick a side. Help the Godslayer? Or weave the future around him? Choose your side. Take your places.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
