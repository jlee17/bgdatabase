			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;ERA (Electronic Roleplaying Assistant) is the ultimate companion for Rolemaster campaigns. Using ERA players can create their characters using a step by step wizard, then level them up and configure all details in stats, skills and special abilities, even overriding the automatic calculations. Afterwards, they can be added to a running campaign in the adventuring module. From there, the game master can control all aspects of the game: resolve maneuvers, resistances, resting, and of course, spell casting and combat.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;With ERA you can create Rolemaster characters and then manage their adventures. Players can also monitor their characters from their mobile devices as the action progresses. But no adventure is complete without some gritty combat. Blows must be dealt, and damage resolved. In the free base ERA product you will find 2 sample weapons and 3 critical tables.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This feature package adds all attack and critical tables in [RMC Arms Law]. Arm your characters with 30 different weapons from the sling to the battle axe, and your monsters with 11 different natural attacks. Or just go bare handed with martial arts strikes or throws. For increased damage, deal some of Rolemaster's acclaimed criticals.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;ERA is compatible with Windows, Mac OSX and Linux.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
