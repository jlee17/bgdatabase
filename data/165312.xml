			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Dreaded Curses Return!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In folklore and fantasy media, curses are powerful supernatural forces that are not to be trifled with, which can take on lives of their own, and respond to the actions of the poor wretches unfortunate enough to have been accursed. These curses are mysterious and terrifying, punishing transgressors for their misdeeds and reacting to the events that happen to their victims, sometimes even becoming adversaries in and of themselves. In Pathfinder and the 3.5 OGL however, curses are just a minor nuisance that is quickly resolved with remove curse or break enchantment.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This book includes all of the rules for mythic curses, originally found in Mythic Mastery: Mythic Curses, but also includes five new mythic curses. Mythic curses use the mythic rules presented in Mythic Adventures as a starting point to create dynamic curses, which respond (positively or negatively) to the actions of their victims, and which generally require a whole lot more than a simple spell to get rid of. Included in this book are such dreaded mythic curses as the curse of cowardice, which fills its victims with overwhelming fear at the worst possible times, the curse of shrinking, which causes the victim to shrink to incredibly tiny sizes, and may even shrink them permanently, the curse of transfiguration, which transforms victims into various beasts and objects, and tampers with his memory and sense of identity, and even more dangerous curses beyond those!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
