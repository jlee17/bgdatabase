			               													<description>From the Foreword:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It's been a very long time since I last put pen to paper about a fantasy adventure for skyships. During my time at TSR, I had the pleasure and privilege of writing a series of stories about flying ships and gung-ho explorers on a quest to unveil the far-flung reaches of their magical world. Three years later, the market had evolved, the company changed, and the stories came to an end. With no option to keep the familiar heroes alive, I buried my old dreams. Out of the ashes at long last, a new tale now emerges in these pages, with another generation of adventurers and a world of their own. I am nervous and worried of course, but also excited and brimming with ideas and endless stories to tell. This first book, In Stranger Skies, covers an awful lot of ground, introducing a new crew and their ship. It also sketches out an entire universe, from planets, their sun, and a central world, Calidar, to a specific kingdom, Meryath, right down to the streets of its capital city. Races dwelling in this universe and their gods are depicted as well, along with a collection of skyships and mechanics to travel from the sky to space's starry vault. Though guidelines help adapt this fantasy setting to the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, the World of Calidar isn't a game. Rather it provides a story and background information for use with any game system. With this long-overdue book, I now invite you to discover the heart and soul of this brave new universe.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
