						               													<description>Forza Horizon 2 is an upcoming racing video game developed for Microsoft's Xbox 360 and Xbox One consoles. It is the sequel to 2012's Forza Horizon and part of the Forza Motorsport series. The game will be developed by Sumo Digital for Xbox 360 and Playground Games for Xbox One, with Forza Motorsport series developer Turn 10 Studios supporting both builds.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Forza Horizon 2 again takes place during the fictional &amp;quot;Horizon Festival&amp;quot;, this time being held in southern Europe, focusing on southern France and northern Italy. The game world has approximately three times more drivable area than that for the original Forza Horizon, with events set in Provence, Tuscany and C&amp;ocirc;te d'Azur, among other regions.[citation needed] Players will explore the region, taking part in races and special events in order to advance through the game. Events can take place at day or night, and a dynamic weather system is being added for the first time in a Forza-series game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Among new features in the game is the &amp;quot;Bucket List&amp;quot;, which is a group of challenges for the player to complete, similar to the 1000 Club in Forza Horizon. There will be two separate lists; one for France and another for Italy. It has also been confirmed that these challenges will be continuously updated to provide new challenges throughout the map. Car Meets are an online mode where players can meet up online and compare their cars, similar to &amp;quot;Forzavista&amp;quot; mode in Forza Motorsport 5. Players will also be able to interact with each other in Car Meets, including sharing tuning setups and liveries.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Forza Horizon 2&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
