			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Clashing magics and warring armies have changed the nature of reality forever. The Blue Flame Waste is what remains. There blue light shines from cracks deep in the surface of the earth as though some hidden light source glowed below. Intimidating growths surround the fissures. Blue flames dance above. Yet people live here. A blacksmith with a mystic bent uses the blue flame to fashion swords that are the natural enemies of corruption. Flame hunters capture strange beasts formed from blue fire and sentience combined. A mage priest disguised as a bandit takes captives to the labyrinths below the waste. He sends them off to Mistmoore or Dark Ridge Pass or similar portals of reality shifting magic. For you, adventurer, there&amp;rsquo;s much to put right here. You&amp;rsquo;ve got the skills. Just watch your step. This is the edge of the Astral Plane. Don&amp;rsquo;t slip between the realms.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
