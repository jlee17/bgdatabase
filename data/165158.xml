			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the latest issue of toys for the sandbox we go shopping and while we found everything we were looking for we found a lot more besides. This issue has people with secrets, things pretending to be people with secrets and things that used to be people telling the truth. Add to all that political tensions, slave traders and family drama you will find a lot of hooks in this issue, as well as maps, items, NPCs and flavor text.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
