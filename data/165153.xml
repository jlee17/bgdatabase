			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This week toys for the sandbox heads north once more. This time we stop to visit a small town with a historic jail built from a local stone with magical properties. The jail played a role in the kingdom's most recent revolt but that is not its only claim to fame. Warden Stonegazer is a dwarf who has lived a long and eventful life, he has been a paladin and turned away from his god when asked to do something he was not willing to.&amp;#10;Add political prisoners, a possibly magical suit of armor and a second secret jail there is plenty of opportunities for adventure at the Northern Jail.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
