			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A stunning sandbox adventure for 2nd-level characters!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A legacy of death bears bitter fruit in the northern coastlands, as brothers long separated rise to the call of their darkling heritage. A new destiny has arisen in the west that threatens to shake the foundations of an empire half a world away, but not if Ranulfr the White Wolf and his one-eyed sibling can waylay these would-be heroes on their road to destiny! Bandits hound their steps, driving them from danger to danger, until their road reaches its bitter and bloody end - for them or their enemies!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Road to Destiny is a 36-page sandbox adventure for 2nd-level characters using the 5th edition of the world's most famous roleplaying game. It delivers clever combats, negotiation and investigation, a delightful mix of urban and wilderness adventure possibilities, and roleplaying possibilities aplenty. The adventure can be played on its own as a self-contained campaign adventure or as part of an epic Adventure Path campaign that journeys from the northern coastlands to the Far East.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
