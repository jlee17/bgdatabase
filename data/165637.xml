			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;FANTASY ROLEPLAYING IN WORLDS OF EPIC ADVENTURE&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Magic World is a set of rules to allow you and your friends to tell astounding stories of fantasy and myth. The rules explain what actions are available within the game, while remaining intuitive so that they do not get in the way of your enjoyment of the stories.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The rules to Magic World are easily remembered. Most tasks can be resolved with a single roll of the dice. Character creation is quick and intuitive, with numerous options as to character race, skills, etc.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;But don&amp;rsquo;t take our word for it. Grab some dice and friends and forge the stuff of legends!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Magic World Quick-Start booklet collects the essential rules for Magic World and presents them in abbreviated form. The Magic World Quick-Start booklet also comes with a one-shot scenario, &amp;quot;The Fishsinger's Daughter&amp;quot;, as well as 10 characters that are ready to be brought to life! This is a fully-playable roleplaying game system, a framework of rules aimed at allowing players to enact a sort of improvisational radio theater&amp;mdash;only without microphones&amp;mdash;and with dice determining whe&amp;shy;ther the characters succeed or fail at what they attempt to do. In roleplaying games, one player takes on the role of the gamemaster (GM), while the other player(s) assume the roles of player characters (PCs) in the game. The gamemaster also acts out the roles of characters who aren&amp;rsquo;t being guided by players: these are called non-player characters (NPCs).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
