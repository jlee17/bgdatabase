			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Adurite Empire once ruled a major portion of Filbar but when the culture lost the favor of the gods it spelled doom for the entire civilization. In the wake of the carnage that followed the major cities fell to fires, plagues, and other disasters both natural and magical. In the centuries that have passed the cities are now in ruins but rumored to still hold magic and wealth. The most famous of these cities was the port city of Leptis Magna. The city was once the crossroads of the empire and was known for trading, agriculture, and magic. What treasures remain in the ruins so fierce that even pirates avoid the area?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This was also the adventure played at Gen Con 2014! This adventure setting was designed for 1st/2nd Edition AD&amp;amp;D for the Filbar Campaign for a mid to high level group of adventurers and DM.  This adventure is easily adaptable to most any game and system. Save yourself some time and utilize it for a one shot adventure or a continuing campaign!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
