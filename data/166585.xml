						               													<description>Thumbs Up is a simulation game for camp management and recreation leadership training. By experiencing various simulated situations the players will gain skill in solving camp leadership problems. The game is intended to provide the student of camp management real-life situations to deal with and gives the experienced camp director a chance to be evaluated on how they are performing their responsibilities.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The players start on a space representing the first week of camp in June and proceed to the end of camp in August. In turn, players must respond aloud to various simulated camp challenges and their movement along the board will be determined by the number of &amp;quot;thumbs up&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;thumbs down&amp;quot; they receive from the other players for their answer. The first players who makes it to the end of camp (in August) wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
