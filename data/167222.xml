			               													<description>From Introduction:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Alpha Complex is the last bastion of humanity, an utopian arcology hidden away from the mutant-ravaged, communist-infested outside world. Under the wise guidance of the Computer, Citizens are indoctrinated from the time they fist develop within their cloning chambers to be inexhaustibly industrious, unwaveringly loyal, and unquestioningly obedient.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As a Troubleshooter, you are tasked with completing those duties deemed too dangerous to risk any valuable droids or higher-clearance Citizens. Your missions may take you into the bowels of Alpha Complex, to the hideous wilds of the Outdoors, or perhaps to the ever-dangerous Protein Reclamation Processing Center. But whatever you have been assigned, a Troubleshooter must complete their tasks with loyalty in their hearts and smiles on their faces!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Lately, painstakingly compiled reports have indicated that Troubleshooters have suffered from a deficiency in their dopamine output, resulting in corruption and betrayal within the Clone ranks. In an effort to increase the Happiness Coefficient, the Computer has declared it necessary for conflicts to be settled with rhythmical ambulatory exercises...or as the Master Programmers would call it &amp;ndash; DANCE! Remember, Happiness is Mandatory!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Any claims that the Computer has seriously malfunctioned are treasonous.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
