						               													<description>Doorways is a survival horror game in which nothing is what it seems. With diverse enigmas, changing gameplay and the scariest environments, you will have to overcome your fears if you want to get to the end and discover the truth.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You'll visit terrifying places, but... How did you get there? Everything is diffuse. What's real? What kind of nightmare is this that can hurt you or even kill you? Why do you remember things you never lived?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Will you unveil the different mysteries while your deepest fears lurk upon you? Will you step through the gates without knowing where they lead to? In Doorways, every threshold will get you to a different world.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Doorways will scare you with the shocks and deep psychological fears that you would expect from these types of games, while testing your tolerance to horror and your capacity to solve problems under pressure. Do you think you have what it takes to survive?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Source: The Game Website.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
