			               													<description>From the Introduction:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;        'Not tonight, sorry.'&amp;#10;        'Sorry, I'm busy.'&amp;#10;        'I've got a big project at work.'&amp;#10;        'Can't this weekend. It's my little one's birthday.'&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;How often have we heard, or said, something similar to the above?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;However, even that is better than moving to a new area and not having anyone to play with. Which happened to me.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I thought my roleplaying days were finished.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I was wrong; I found a new way to roleplay.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I discovered solo roleplaying.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Solo roleplaying is a way to roleplay when you are unable to roleplay with mates. It can't take the place of time around the table, but solo roleplaying gives you a deep roleplaying experience, one that requires only yourself. The only excuses you'll hear are the ones you bring.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are three key elements to exploring solo roleplaying:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Know Roleplaying&amp;#10;     Know Thy Self&amp;#10;     Know Thy Toolbox&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In this guide I'll help you explore all three and give you guidelines on how to start roleplaying alone.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
