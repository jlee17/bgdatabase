His infamous deeds have earned him the title &amp;quot;The Most Dangerous Man in Europe&amp;quot; in the Allied press.

It includes a summery of his background and tracks his rapid rise through the ranks of the SS. It also includes a personality description and information on his combat methods.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This file features:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Details on the life and adventures of Otto Skorzeny&amp;#10;     Adventure hooks and setting information&amp;#10;     d20 stats for Otto and his gear (including an experimental combat suit)&amp;#10;     d20 stats for a new prestige class (the Combat Master)&amp;#10;     d20 stats for a new template (Thule Warrior)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
