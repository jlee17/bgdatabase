						               													<description>Who wants to make some music with Sammy the squirrel? Kleine Musik-Macher, part of HABA's &amp;quot;My Very First Games&amp;quot; line, includes eight different games with simple rules that don't take long to play: Enjoy games of listening to bells, music memory, a musical dice race, games that require you to listen carefully, and cooperative games, as well as games with physical activity. The variety of game ideas, the four handbells, and the wonderfully illustrated game materials ensure hours of entertainment.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Music fosters linguistic and intellectual aptitude, as well as motor skills in children. In games and activities designed specifically for them, children are given the opportunity to experiment with sounds, beats and rhythms, and acquire essential skills while playing.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
