			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There is another version of the world, a sinister version where dark gods plot conquest. The Dread Pit is their portal and, though the pit has been sealed off for some time, Ambostus finds it. The portal is a clockwork construct with winding and unwinding springs. He slides a lever into the slowly moving gears and that unseals it. They say the Dread Pit was used to kill a god and that may be true, but one thing is certain. When the pit was sealed, Commonwealth soldiers got locked inside. Now they&amp;rsquo;re free. In a sense. So is former slave, Ambostus. But freedom doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean anyone is going to live happily ever after. It&amp;rsquo;s time to stick some shivs in this plot amalgam and determine how the changes forced upon these guys get writ as history. Help them, or don&amp;rsquo;t, but be careful -  don&amp;rsquo;t step on the runes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
