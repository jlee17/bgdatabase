			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Complete Golden Age Oddballs spotlights obscure characters from the Golden Age of comic books, in many cases collecting the stories in one place for the first time ever. Each issue in the series contain every single appearance of one or more quirky heroes from the founding years of the comic book genre, along with all-new roleplaying game content and an occassional bit of fiction.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In this volume, we spotlight the Fireman and the Buzzard, two 1941 creations from the mind and pen of Martin Filchock, Centaur Publishing's go-to creator for exhuberant, crazy superhero content.  In addition to every single Golden Age appearance of both characters, this book contains brief publication histories for each; an overview of how they are being incorporated into NUELOW Games' emerging comic book universe (which will also be featured in Lester Smith's CORE Roleplaying Game); and a bonus expansion to the OGL Modern superhero rules first published in Madden's Boys.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As an extra special treat, the book also contains all for pages of Teen Toons, which Filchock produced in 1948 for Fox Features Syndicate. Even better--it's all presented in color!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Trivia: When Martin Filchock passed away in 2012 at the age of 100, he was America's (and possible the world's) oldest working cartoonist. He had stated in an interview a few years earlier that achieving that status had become his final goal during his twilight years.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
