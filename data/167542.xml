						               													<description>THEME&amp;#10;...it's the year 2099.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The polar ice caps melted 10 years ago, resulting in a rapid increase in the world's sea level. &amp;#10;Cities drowned, the world's plains turned into lakes, mountains became islands.&amp;#10;Whole populations were wiped out.&amp;#10;The food shortage brought the wars...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Now we are all divided into 4 main alliances, where each one fights for the last remaining pieces of land.&amp;#10;Each one struggles to reach the pivotal point and control... The 5th Land&amp;#10;&amp;#10;THE BOARD&amp;#10;The board can be setup to show 11.664 different map formations,&amp;#10;assuring a different world every time you play and always the need for a new strategy.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;GAMEPLAY&amp;#10;In The5thLand, each player represents one of the 4 main alliances whose aim is to occupy 5 lands, by controling the worlds resources, bankrupting their enemies and ultimately by war.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the beginning each player starts with 2 Lands, 2 Army units and a Supply Center with 5 of each resources  and 75 Million Credits.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each Round consists of 4 main Phases where the players have the opportunity to:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    Extract the resources from the territories they occupy.&amp;#10;    Build additional Military units (Land/Air/Navy).&amp;#10;    Trade on the world markets, Resources and Military units.&amp;#10;    Move military units around the globe to achieve a strategic advantage and Attack when the time is right...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The players may act or not in each Phase (clockwise direction) and when all have played, they move on the next Phase.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;VICTORY&amp;#10;When at least one player occupies five Lands, the game finishes at the end of that Round. &amp;#10;If two or more players have at least five lands, then the player with the most lands wins.&amp;#10;If there is still a tie, then the player with the most money, minus any loans, wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;THE NATIONS&amp;#10;The world has come together to form 4 main alliances, each one having a unique advantage in the game:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    Demeter Federation: an Eco-friendly society, whose efforts have resulted in an abundance of food resources.&amp;#10;    Dionysus Coalition: the scavengers of the world, rumor has it that they can smell Oil from a mile away.&amp;#10;    Hephaestus League: the steampunk nation, with a special affinity for Gold.&amp;#10;    Poseidon Empire: the sea power of the game, their motto: 'In a world of water, Ships are gods'.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
