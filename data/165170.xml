			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The druids of the moon song grove have been worried for a while now, the consolation known as &amp;quot;The Temple&amp;quot; has been behaving oddly disappearing from the night sky and reappearing. They have taken it as a dark omen. Now an ancient temple has reappeared, or perhaps just been discovered depending on who you listen to. Legend has it this is not just any temple but the first temple built on the site where the gods first appeared to man.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
