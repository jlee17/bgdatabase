The player with the most ships along the most  number of trade routes is declared &amp;ldquo;Nauclerokubernetes&amp;rdquo;, the Greek word for merchant-master.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Materials&amp;#10;64 double sided tiles, two sets of 32 tiles in two colors Red and Green.&amp;#10;A way of keeping score.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Play&amp;#10;Come About is played on a board-less playing surface.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Two players Red and Green have each two sets of 16 double sided tiles in their chosen color.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Red starts by placing a tile either side up onto the table.&amp;#10; Players then take turns placing a tile alongside another existing tile, connecting trade routes ( the dotted lines) across tile edges.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends when all the tiles have been played.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A trade route is a continuous dotted line or loop containing 3 or more ships in either players color.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The player having the majority of ships in his color on a trade route scores 1 point for each of his ships. If a trade route has an equal number of ships in both colors, then neither player scores along that trade route.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The player with the highest score wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
