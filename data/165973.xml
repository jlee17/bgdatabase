						               													<description>Driftmoon is a 2013 adventure roleplaying video game. The game also contains a built-in mod editor.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The beautiful, enchanted world of Driftmoon trembles in the shadow of a forgotten evil, for the dark King Ixal is again gathering his forces.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Hope lies in an unlikely alliance&amp;mdash;the player's character joins forces with a little firefly dreaming of stardom, a panther queen with the ego of a moon whale, and a very determined fellow who has lost everything except his bones. This group embarks on a journey to defeat King Ixal.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gameplay&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When Driftmoon first starts, it automatically installs any new updates. The player can turn off this feature on the &amp;quot;Settings&amp;quot; menu.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The &amp;quot;Settings&amp;quot; menu also permits the player to select whether the game runs in &amp;quot;fullscreen&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;windowed&amp;quot; mode.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the start of a new game, the player selects a &amp;quot;difficulty level&amp;quot;:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Adventurer (least difficult)&amp;#10;Champion&amp;#10;Warlord&amp;#10;Guardian (most difficult)&amp;#10;The difficulty level can be changed during gameplay via the &amp;quot;Options&amp;quot; menu.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Driftmoon's rudimentary set of key bindings can also be changed via the &amp;quot;Options&amp;quot; menu. Notable key commands include &amp;quot;pause combat&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;toggle item highlights&amp;quot; (to indicate items on the ground and objects in the environment for user interaction), &amp;quot;show map&amp;quot; (to display the current area's local map), and tilt camera up / down (the default view of the game's 2D graphics is a top-down perspective).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A game can be saved / loaded at any point during gameplay; Driftmoon provides eight &amp;quot;Save&amp;quot; slots. In addition, the game generates autosaves (for example, upon entering an area).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The adventure game aspect of Driftmoon is evident in its various puzzles, which are not too difficult to solve.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game has various bosses.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Features relatively unique to Driftmoon include&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Good game balance&amp;mdash;the player does not need to constantly pick up drops from killed enemies and run to a merchant to sell useless items&amp;#10;Waypoints&amp;mdash;As the player explores an area, the game automatically sets waypoints&amp;#10;Player feedback&amp;mdash;Throughout the game, the player can press the &amp;quot;f&amp;quot; key to display a feedback form. The completed form is automatically sent to the developer along with, if the player desires, an automatically generated screenshot.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Driftmoon&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
