			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Good luck. This one ain&amp;rsquo;t pretty. Who knows if it was the Emperor of Shiel who kept the powers of darkness at bay? But it for sure is true that once he made a pact with Kryzcazzca, his whole establishment became a roiling production for all kinds of dark powers unhealthy to humanoid types. Now with the Emperor turned into a dark oracle, what hope does an abandoned wife like Disel have? Is a monk who writes symphonies  doomed? What about Hosltler, that investigative librarian? What power does a fighting intellectual have against the multiple faces of evil he and Disel butt heads against? Only thing to do is pick a side. Maybe join the party? They&amp;rsquo;re still fighting. Does that mean truth and right prevail? Or? Who knows. The only thing to do right now is to fight off the spiders and those Monsterwood productions that keep dropping in the background. God bless&amp;hellip;But which God and who?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
