			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Look! Right there! What a marvel! The Egg of Wonder is spinning out. It&amp;rsquo;s pantomiming something! It&amp;rsquo;s the future! It&amp;rsquo;s the past!  But don&amp;rsquo;t watch too closely. You&amp;rsquo;ll  miss the love story playing out at the Vintners Inn in standard, clock-based time. It&amp;rsquo;s a triangle, really. Who gets the Earl? Will it be the glamorous singing thief? The seeker disguised as a vintner? If you don&amp;rsquo;t want to watch the lovers, you can scratch straight through time based reality altogether and watch the history of the old inn - the ghosts and magicked properties that crawl through the spaces just outside chronological reality. Unbeknownst as well, the ice elementals from the Astral Star are waiting close on hand for the King to arrive. And the lycanthropes, yes, they are prowling, too, just outside the window when the jewel thief sings. It will be hard to keep the strands untangled as you play out this corner of the saga. But here&amp;rsquo;s a clue &amp;ndash; keep your eye on all the levels&amp;hellip;don&amp;rsquo;t be too human&amp;hellip;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
