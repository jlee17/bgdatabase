			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It&amp;rsquo;s a lie. Elves aren&amp;rsquo;t superior. Long ago elves kicked halflings out of their homeland with that powerful lie and built consensus on the battlefield, making everybody believe it. But as far as the halflings are concerned, nothing&amp;rsquo;s settled yet. They want a just and lasting victory - one that lets them go home. Halflings are mostly assimilated in Iron Wall and run a thriving inn there. They call it the Lasting Victory. They lay a fine table, serve a mean meal and the d&amp;eacute;cor is spiffy. But it&amp;rsquo;s a front. The Lasting Victory is a cover for spies working to put elves in their place and get halflings back home. They&amp;rsquo;re waiting for you there, so it&amp;rsquo;s time you got serious. Go to the Lasting Victory. The Laughing Monkey will have a prophecy for you there. He won&amp;rsquo;t be joking, so listen up and act.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
