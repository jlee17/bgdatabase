						               													<description>This game includes 4 different playing options:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I. Turno-Race: The tiles form a race track (see box cover). Movement is determined by a die. If a player gets on a tile with an even number of dots, he turns the tile and advances as many tiles as dots show up. If a player rolls an odd number, he hast to go backward and may not turn the tile.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;II. Turno-Lottery: The tiles form a 6-pointed star. The players place their meeple on a tile. If the die shows the number of their tile, they may remove the tile. The first player to remove all 6 tiles of his leg of the star, wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;III. Turno-Domino: The 6-edged center tile is placed on the table. The players draw tiles and add one at a time to the center tile, till a six pointed star is formed. The first player to use up all his tiles wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;IV. Turno-Boardgame: The 36 tiles combine to a game board of 6x6 tiles. The meeples start on a corner tile, have to cross the board to any tile on the other side and return to their starting tile, to win the game. Movement is determined by a die. If a player, for instance, rolls a 5 he can advance to a neighbouring tile, that shows 5 dots, or he can go to a tile showing 3 dots and further to a tile showing 2 dots.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
