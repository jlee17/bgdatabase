			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Halloween is one thing, but this story goes a whole lot further than a spook ever traveled. A kid stomps water on a witch and she gets so mad she kills all the male type people in town? And she doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop there. She displaces part of the soul of every living villager as well and scatters the fragments throughout the universe. Now the villagers need to eat the flesh of others to find their stolen soul bits. All this nastiness propelled the village outside of time &amp;ndash; messed with the weather of reality and made them a wild card even the Godslayer can&amp;rsquo;t manipulate. It put the God Who Never Was back into play too, so maybe what the witch started will someday save the world. Want to volunteer? Pick up a soul trinket to make the cannibals want you. Avoid getting roasted, then help bamboozle the Godslayer.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
