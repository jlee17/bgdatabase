			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the capital of pirate island, the small and exclusive port of Slacksail, there is a sail maker&amp;rsquo;s shop run by an elf who is one of the masters of his craft. However he came to the island not to make sails but to find revenge. He has teamed with others that want to see the destruction of the pirates and it is almost time for his plans to unfold.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
