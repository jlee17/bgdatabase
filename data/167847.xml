						               													<description>User Summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You are a vampire, trying to reach your coffin in this roguelike game. You can move one hexagon a turn. But beware, so do the humters move a hexagon a turn. Stay in the shadows. If the light the hunters make reaches you, they will chase you down. If you are next to a hunter though, and in the shadows you can bite them. Bite them a second time to drink their blood and regain health. You can also turn into a bat or fog. They allow you to pass through objects and the fog allows you to disappear and even pass through enemies. These cost health however. Each round the damage or health gained previously carries over. Each round you can select one upgrade.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
