						               													<description>SpeakEasy is a game where players complete social missions. Most missions involve meeting people and making new friends. Others involve competing against your friends in outrageous challenges! Missions are printed on reusable coasters, which fit right in at your local bar, cocktail party, or picnic!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;HOW DO I PLAY?&amp;#10;SpeakEasy is so simple to play, even an inebriate could learn! Here are the rules:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1. Draw a coaster. Read the mission out loud to the group.&amp;#10;2. Assign the mission to another player. &amp;#10;3. That player has 3 minutes to complete the mission.&amp;#10;4. If they succeed, they win the coaster. If they fail (or refuse!), you win it. &amp;#10;5. The first player to collect 5 coasters wins!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;SAMPLE MISSIONS&amp;#10;SpeakEasy has over 25 missions. Each one is designed to stretch your social circle, and introduce you to new people! Here are some samples:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Comic Relief &amp;#10;&amp;quot;Target player must make a stranger laugh!&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Getting Fresh&amp;#10;&amp;quot;Choose two players. The first one to return with a piece of gum wins this coaster.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Playing with Matches&amp;#10;&amp;quot;Target player must introduce themselves to a stranger of your choice!&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
