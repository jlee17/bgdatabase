						               													<description>User Summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Desolate Hope mixes several gameplay styles from a platformer to an 8-bit overhead dungeon crawler to a JRPG style battles.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;An unmanned research vessel sent from Earth constructed the Lun Infinus station that was designed to explore possibilities of human colonization, with five sentient computers, Derelicts. The project was later abandoned. During the years, a strange computer virus has emerged and the virus of unknown origins has been slowly ravaging the Derelicts. More than 30 years later, Coffee is the last mobile resident of the station, a small service robot who spends his days keeping the station and the Derelicts operational, while fighting the virus attacks.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
