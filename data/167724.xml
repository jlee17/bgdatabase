						               													<description>Dungeon Talk (DT) has been described as a hilarious mix of Dixit, Apples to Apples, Munchkin, and with a sprinkle of story telling fantasy RPG. DT can be learned in 5 minutes and played in under 30 minutes with endless replayability.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Dungeon Talk is a 2-6 player fantasy party game for family, adults, and kids and comes with over 280 game cards with 12,000 variations for endless re-playability.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Basic Game Overview: In the basic game, a new fantasy picture is revealed (each picture is on a huge 6x4 card). Players choose a Talk Card from their hand which they feel best represents the picture, is the most silly, or drums up the most laughs. One player acts as the Adventure Master, which rotates every turn, reads each Talk Card aloud then chooses a Talk Card he/she likes most. This continues every turn until a player's Talk Card is chosen three times!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Advanced Game Overview:  After choosing your hero (each having a unique game power), you'll draw 5 Dungeon Talk cards (talk cards have funny sayings, quotes, etc on them).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Talk cards are used by you to describe an adventure card (a fantasy scene with some really cool art). Each turn a new adventure card is drawn from the current Act deck of your quest. The acts are The Fellowship, Journey, and Destination.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each turn a new player acts as the Adventure Master (AM). Players, except the AM, chooses a talk card from their hand and plays it face down.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The AM then draws a random talk card from the talk card deck and shuffles it in with the players' chosen talk cards. He reads aloud each talk card and chooses one he/she feels best describes the picture, is the funniest, most outrageous, drums up the most laughs, and so on.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If a player's card is chosen he gains a level and loot (loot can be in the form of gold coins, equipment,potions, spells, or weapons which can be used to aid yourself or hinder others).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If the random card was chosen, one player is cursed (a random negative effect is played on him). Throughout the game, players can use their special hero power and unique items they've earned to help themselves or hinder other players getting too close to winning!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends when a player reaches glorious level 5! Whomever has accumulated the most gold wins! There's a few more rules but that's the general gist of Dungeon Talk.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
