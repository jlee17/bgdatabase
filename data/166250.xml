At the game menu, players can change the background, the board color and the music. The game offers support for the Official Scrabble Players Dictionary and a hint system for novice Scrabble players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In addition to the main stand-alone mode, Scrabble Complete offers network play. There are also several educational word games, such as word riddles and anagram search, included with Scrabble Complete. Some copies of the game also include the 1997 Boggle computer game as a bonus.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Scrabble Complete&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
