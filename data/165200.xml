			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The City by the Sea has seen an influx of new residents fleeing the destruction of war in the north. There are those who fear these newcomers, afraid they have come to take over the city and drive out the locals. Nothing could be further from the truth. Most of the refugees just want to take back their home, but  for now the closest the refugees can get to home is a small bakery that makes the food they remember from before the war between the  orcs and the druids drove them south.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
