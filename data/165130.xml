			               													<description>Publisher's blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Throughout the history of epic fantasy, one thing never changes: War! Now you and your friends will be able to portray all the heroism and drama of a grand battle as your PCs lead men and monsters in conflict on the field of battle. Dire Destiny Books presents a new system that truly weds the individual heroics and derring-do of fantasy roleplay to the epic sweep and scope of wargaming, allowing player characters to engage in tactical leadership and use their unique abilities to the fullest. Your characters can now range from one end of the battlefield to the other, leading charges, rallying stragglers, challenging enemy officers and having a direct effect on the performance and morale of the troops under their command. Gather your bannermen and draw your maps of conquest, but remember: no plan survives contact with the enemy...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
