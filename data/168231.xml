						               													<description>Released in october 2014.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Contains:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    St. Francis of Assisi: was an Italian Catholic friar and preacher. He founded the men's Order of Friars Minor, the women&amp;rsquo;s Order of St. Clare, and the Third Order of Saint Francis for men and women not able to live the lives of itinerant preachers, followed by the early members of the Order of Friars Minor, or the monastic lives of the Poor Clares. Though he was never ordained to the Catholic priesthood, Francis is one of the most venerated religious figures in history.&amp;#10;    Barbarossa: Holy Roman Emperor, he got the name Barbarossa from the northern Italian cities he attempted to rule: Barbarossa means &amp;quot;red beard&amp;quot; in Italian. In German, he was known as Kaiser Rotbart, which has the same meaning.&amp;#10;    Genghis Khan: was the founder and Great Khan (emperor) of the Mongol Empire, which became the largest contiguous empire in history after his demise.&amp;#10;    Marco Polo: was an Italian merchant traveller. He was not the first European to reach China (see Europeans in Medieval China), but he was the first to leave a detailed chronicle of his experience.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
