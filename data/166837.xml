			               													<description>From the Introduction:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Sixth Factor stands out from other RPGs as it utilizes the concept of what many call the Sixth Sense. It's the Sixth stat of what each character has, and is unique in how it operates. It's an ability all can choose to develop, but most will not due to how it operates (perhaps similar to real life).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The basic rules can be played in any campaign or world, however the main surroundings of the Sixth Factor is an apocalyptic type fantasy world where the adventurers travel the wastelands seeking ways to bring back the previous glories of the world.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Basic conflict resolution - Resolution of conflict is simple. You take the same characteristic of each character. Each rolls 1d12 and adds that characteristic to the total rolled. Whoever has the higher number, is the victor. Ties always go to the defender.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A secondary conflict resolution that is occasionally utilized, especially when it is something being resolved within oneself instead of outwardly, is to roll 1d12 and try to roll under the relevant characteristic.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
