			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;Because Making Spaceships is AWESOME!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If you're going to playing in the Space Era, you're going to want to be able to get into Space.  Here is a set of guidelines for the creation of spaceships of all types in the Victory System!  From tiny personal craft to massive Space Opera-style battle cruisers, this guide has what you need.  Build your spacecraft from a list of components, modify those components to suit your needs, or come up with your own components to customize your designs to YOUR campaign!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Even if you need something exotic, like a spacecraft made of living biological tissue, or one that uses magic instead of technology, this guide has you covered.  A spacecraft piloted by disembodied brains wired into the controls?  Check.  A ship piloted by the power of Thought alone?  Of course!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Victory System Guide to Spaceships Includes:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    Streamlined rules for creating Spaceships... for Players, GMs, AND in-game by Characters!&amp;#10;    Dozens of components, including different power systems, space-drives (both Slower Than Light and Faster Than Light), life-support, data systems, matter transmitters, and everything else needed to make fully-realized spacecraft!&amp;#10;    Weapons and weapon-like systems for arming and customizing your spacecraft, from lasers and torpedoes to force fields and tractor beams!&amp;#10;    &amp;quot;Tweaks&amp;quot; for components and weapons so they match the performance you're looking for!&amp;#10;    Rules for Artificial Intelligences for ships and other systems, and sample AI characters!&amp;#10;    A sampling of space ships of every Weight Class, ready to use!&amp;#10;    Expanded rules for Space combat!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;No matter what kind of Spaceship you want to throw into your game setting, here's how to do it.  Remember, &amp;quot;in space, no one can hear you scream.&amp;quot;  Unless you've installed the appropriate communications system, that is!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
