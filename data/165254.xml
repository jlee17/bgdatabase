			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Growing up in the canyons, Alphonse has seen many dark tides and seen the pillar of holy fire burn bright in the ruins of the city. He has seen strange creatures come out of The Narrows and stranger adventurers go in after them. But for the most part, Alphonse keeps these stories to himself. Not so Agline, a battered adventurer. Right now, stories she tells are fueling talk in the bars of the unaligned. Vanifric, knight of the Society of the Rose, he just watches. So does Privitine, the eye of the Great Worm. She watches Vanifric. He watches the prison of the Demon King. And, you? What role will you play? Whatever else -  don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid. The demons feed on fear. So, pick, choose, decide. Try. Be a player. Save the canyon.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
