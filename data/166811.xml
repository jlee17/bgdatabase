			               													<description>From the Introduction:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Mad Dash for Cash is a game about a group of people who find out about an unclaimed cache of money and begin a mad scramble to find it. It seeks to emulate stories such as It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World and its various clones. Characters will be allies with those that they travel with, but traveling companions may change throughout the game, so that your ally may become your rival. In contrast to many RPGs, this game could be considered to have winners and losers: the goal is to reach the treasure first and the group of characters that does so could be reasonably described as the winners. However, the point of the game is not to win, but to have fun telling a zany story. This is decidedly a silly game. It will play best if the players are also decidedly silly.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
