			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the very bottom of Weeping Crater is an island where the rain falls up instead of down and a priest gone bad is stuck cooking for harpies. (Nasty, filthy things.) He hardly gets a bite himself as he slogs through the centuries living out a punishment for gluttony. But now things are changing. Harpy matriarch Aello&amp;rsquo;s great-great-great grandmother predicted that when clouds covered the sun, monsters would fall from the sky - scary stuff because now there are clouds.  Aello is worried - old too. Her wings are crumpled and arthritic. She wants the party to get her out of the crater. The priest wants out too. And the cartographer from #113? She may need help as well. She&amp;rsquo;s still down there, mapping the crater floor. But aid is close at hand - harpy feather tea helps with travel. Just boil it long and nobody will get sick.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
