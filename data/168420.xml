			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Restless?  Bored?  In need of adventure?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Fret no more!  Join the Grand Safari!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Grand Safari is a campaign featuring six short adventure scenarios which will challenge any traveller.  The Safari, sponsored by the Gentlemen's Club of Dashwood, send the characters into the wilds of the untamed Hannibal Subsector.  There the characters will both work together to face challenges and compete against one another to win the Grand Safari Prize!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Grand Safari also features information on the systems of the Hannibal Subsector.  Located in the Leonidas Sector which is spinward of Clement Sector, the subsector has only been surveyed once, visited rarely, and remains untamed.  It is an excellent backdrop for the Grand Safari as well as future adventures for your characters.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;And what would a safari be without the animals?  Grand Safari has a host of animals for your characters to encounter along with a full set of random encounter charts to aid the Referee in keeping the characters on their toes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Come along for the adventure!  Go on safari!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
