						               													<description>Letterbingo is a simple word game. Players roll 6 dice at once with 1 letter on every side. During a certain time span each player writes down as many words as possible which can be formed by the letters of the dice results. The Hoppe logo can be used as any letter. The player who has formed most words wins the game. Alternatively players can agree to grant 1 point to the player who calls the first correct word after the dice roll. Then play until the first player has reached 10 points. That player wins the game then.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
