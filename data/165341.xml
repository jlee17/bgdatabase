			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Sky City, a mythic, elvish place that branches high above the Long Ridge Mountains, needs some muscle. To volunteer, enter through the Sky Gate and get on the Sky Road &amp;ndash; a tower, actually. It will bring you up to the city itself. Vashana&amp;rsquo;s in charge here. She&amp;rsquo;s liberal, proud of it too, but she&amp;rsquo;s starting to realize her society&amp;rsquo;s gotten way too elastic. Count Rolet&amp;rsquo;s brother, Agustus, inveigled his way in as ambassador. Vashana doesn&amp;rsquo;t know exactly what he&amp;rsquo;s up to, though she&amp;rsquo;s sure it&amp;rsquo;s not good. Agustus knows how to make nice, but contrary to elvish goals, he&amp;rsquo;s in Sky City to develop allies for the Demon King. His plans are fool proof. His patsies are in place to keep blame off himself. Ask Ironline. Talk to Maludine. Decode their stories and tell Vashana what&amp;rsquo;s going on. The future starts here. You need to take charge.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
