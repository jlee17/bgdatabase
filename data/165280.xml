			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Great Dragons are rousing. The battle against the corruption the Godslayer opened in the world is starting up again. But one thing first &amp;ndash; banish the shadows of Sorrows Keep! It&amp;rsquo;s taken several lifetimes, but Shirtena, a powerful mage, knows how to do it. She&amp;rsquo;s perfected a gem that gives off a light that will cut the living shadows to ribbons. But she needs help installing it and that  puts the ball squarely in your court. Probably enlist Alisha from the Falcon Guard? She&amp;rsquo;s got that Poet&amp;rsquo;s Tongue long blade that lives to banish corruption. With her you&amp;rsquo;ll probably get Gwogwore too, a fighter if you ever saw one. And don&amp;rsquo;t worry about his shape shifting proclivities. He&amp;rsquo;s got a righteous sense of ethics and won&amp;rsquo;t be a dangerment to you. Iffy? Yes. But you&amp;rsquo;ll make your legacy. The Dragon of Dawn is waiting for rescue!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
