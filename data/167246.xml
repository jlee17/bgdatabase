			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;MAGARCHY REIGNS!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The world is shaped by those with the means to shape it.  Wealth, power, smarts&amp;hellip; and in your case magic.  You have seen the ills of this world and found them wanting.  You step forward to take your place in the annals of history.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Magarchy is an alternate history fantasy setting in which magic has existed since the dawn of time.  Having somewhat altered the faces and events of the past, magic takes center stage in the Italian Renaissance, when it allows for an early information and industrial age like no other.  Players are Magarchs, those with the magical abilities and will to take part in the major events of the world, whose drama is set in the 16th century England of Henry VIII.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Magarchy takes its inspiration from both history and modern cyberpunk genre stories, posing a thought provoking juxtaposition of places and themes.  Hacking cybertechnologies and slinging powerful spells to fight or aid trans-kingdom companies bent on exploiting the peasant masses, Magarchs find themselves at the center of a timeless conflict between tradition and innovation, church and state, power and principle.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Welcome to the world stage, Magarch.  Hope you brought a weapon.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
