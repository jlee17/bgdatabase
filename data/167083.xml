						               													<description>User Summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A ninja on the loose in the mines! You play as a ninja who is gathering gemstones and stars. Collect as many gemstones as you can. Also try to grab stars. The three stars is best. Control with mouse or keyboard. Push the direction you want to go, and the ninja flies in that direction until hitting an obstacle. Collect tools such as keys and blades that will open areas to you or otherwise interact with the environment. Each level is a puzzle to solve. You must figure out how to get around in the maze to collect as many stars and gems as you can. Sometimes you will jump in the wrong direction and break something you needed with a tool or jump into a dangerous obstacle. But don't worry, you can always restart the level.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
