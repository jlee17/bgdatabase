			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;What could be sweeter than honey? Magical honey, of course. Only problem is, it&amp;rsquo;s only made in Weeping Crater jungle. Very, very dangerous place there, so if you have the where-with-all, don&amp;rsquo;t harvest it yourself. Send someone else &amp;ndash; a slave maybe and send Chethrean along to fight off the bandits. She&amp;rsquo;s available to the highest bidder and if you want tough, Chethrean is tough. She took back her soul after going through the Black Flame Rites at Thunder Cr&amp;egrave;che and, for extra punch, her teacher&amp;rsquo;s soul is in a locket at her throat.  She wants something, but it will probably  dovetail right into your own hopes and needs. Just let her live down in the ruins when the fighting&amp;rsquo;s over. One word of caution? Careful with the honey. Just a spoonful  might make medicine go down, but then there&amp;rsquo;s this honey. No recalls yet, but watch for sudden mutations.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
