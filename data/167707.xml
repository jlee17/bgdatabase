						               													<description>Majdan is trying to simulate events which took place in Ukraine in January and February 2014 during what is called an &amp;ldquo;Euromaidan&amp;rdquo;. The players create the political situation of this state on their own. Depending on their strategy, the paths of Ukrainians future may develop in many different ways. Nevertheless, it must be remembered that the moral loser will always be a faction which decided for the force solution fighting for control over districts as the first and allowing the blood to be spoiled.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The goal of each faction is to gain as many Victory Points as possible, i.e. retain the power in hands of Government and his supporters or to create a new government by the opposition.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Victory Points are scored by taking Control or getting Support in 25 districts, which differs in value. When two factions meet in one district there is a  Struggle (for Support or Control). To win a Struggle, players use Cards which portrays means used to win: Masses (supporters of Government or Euromaidan), Militia, Berkut, Army, Specnaz, Media or Titushki. Cards have different values (value part of them is defined by a dice roll). For example, Media has value 5 in Struggle for Support, and 0 in Struggle for Control.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players has several types of action to choose: get a Card, initiate a Struggle, influence a district, make an peace offer. 5 Actions made an Action Round. 6 Action Rounds makes an complete game (unless someone get to automatic victory earlier).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Majdan reimplements Pomara&amp;#197;&amp;#132;czowa Rewolucja game - mechanics was slightly changed, as district values on the map. Cards was changed (new images and its quantity).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All changes were fit to the 2013/2014 political situation on Ukraine.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
