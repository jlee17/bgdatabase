						               													<description>User Summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Defend your castle from invading skeletons using your bow and arrow. Fire the bows and hit the enemies to kill them. Headshots do more damage. Purchase upgrades to the bow so it will deal more damage, have a faster recharge rate and cause the enemy to be knocked back farther when hit. As you progress more dangerous skeletons will be released upon you castle, but you can also unlock new and more powerful weapons such as the volley which fires a lot of arrows at once or the poison arrow which deals damage per second to any enemy hit by it. The basic bow has unlimited ammunition. Upgrade weapons are limited in capacity. Earn gold after each level to spend on upgrades. Gold is only earned if the level is defeated. Earn 1-3 stars for victory with more gold earned per star.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
