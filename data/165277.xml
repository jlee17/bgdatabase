			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You just may be the person Gretchen is looking for - the one to don the magical armor and bury her mother in her native crypt. The trip will cost you, of course, and staying at Hanging House might be beyond your means, but don&amp;rsquo;t forget the netting below. It&amp;rsquo;s cold there, but hanging there you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to hear the priests and their prayers will shield you from the encroaching undead. Spider John likely might talk the night through - an irritation - but also a distraction. Gretchen is praying for worthy adventurers. Is it you she&amp;rsquo;s praying for? You know you are worthy. Don&amp;rsquo;t shirk this quest. Dark Ridge Pass is a fount of necrotic activity, but you didn&amp;rsquo;t get into this to coast, did you? Step up. Tell Gretchen who you are. Shoulder the corpse. Find the necropolis.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
