			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;I can stalk a deer and wing my shafts as well as any fledgling warrior!&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Starlight was as wild and tempesteous as the wendigo winds, and in her breast beat the heart of a warrior. She viewed with contempt the idea that women should be modest and content to cook and weave for the men who hunted and fended off the enemies of Huron people. So, she termed herself a warrior-maiden, and set out to prove that her arrows struck as true, and her knife cut as deep, as that wielded by any man.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Warrior Maiden Starlight chronicles the adventures of a strong-willed young woman, as she refuses to submit to gender roles in Huron society some two centuries before European settlers made contact with the Native Americans of the northeast.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Starlight was the last in a string of strong female characters to be featured in comics anthologoes from Fiction House, the most famous of these being Sheena, Queen of the Jungle. Originally published in Indians #2 - #8 in 1951, this book is the first time all seven installments of the series have been collected in one volume anywhere. This is a series and a character that don't deserve the total obsurity into which they have fallen, as it's one of the best of its kind. NUELOW Games hopes it will be rediscovered by many readers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In addition to the classic comics by Ralph Mayo (artist of the Judy of the Jungle series, also available from NUELOW Games), Warrior Maiden Starlight features an outline for an OGL d20 game setting titled First Americans, which includes some new feats and game stats for the fearsome Wendio.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
