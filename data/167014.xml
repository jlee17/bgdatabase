			               													<description>From the Introduction:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Welcome to MSF High! On this site, you can find all of the rules you need to create and play as a character in MSF High! With these same basic rules, a GM should be able to run a game, but they will likely want a copy of the Player's guide and the GM's guide, which will become available as soon as possible, to help them understand the setting and how the game is meant to be run. Until then, please enjoy this guide and let me know in the www.msfhigh.com forums what you think about the rules and setting!&amp;#10; &amp;#10;User Summary:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A Google Sites website that presents a complete set of rules for playing the RPG. This is also used as a source for version 3 of the play-by-forum game that runs on the MSF High website forum.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Much of the content of this website is reproduced in the forum posts, with this website being the official rules source.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
