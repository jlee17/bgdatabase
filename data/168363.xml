			               													<description>From publisher blurb:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;One of humankind&amp;rsquo;s most profound emotions is love&amp;hellip; and what better time to talk about love than on Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day? In the machismo-filed world of the retro-toons, love wasn&amp;rsquo;t something that was blatantly bandied about on a regular basis. The characters would rather duke it out or shoot at each other with lasers than engage in romantic situations. That having been said, romance wasn&amp;rsquo;t completely absent from the retro-toons. It was just muted and watered down a bit, making it more tolerable for the target audience.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This mini-sourcebook was written with one goal in mind: to help players and GMs introduce romantic elements into Cartoon Action Hour: Season 2 without violating everything that the retro-toons stood for.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The fist section deals with advice for integrating romance into the game, while the second section presents a series that explores romantic themes more than most others.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
